    <body>&lt;h2&gt;New NLM Visitor Parking Regulations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major building and road construction on the campus of the National Institutes of Health is resulting in many changes for visitors to NIH. Those that affect the NLM:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new attended visitor parking lot has opened across Center Drive from the Library, adjacent to the Natcher Building. Parking costs $2.00 per hour, with a maximum of $12.00 per day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;41 metered parking spaces are available in front of the NLM Building (Building 38). There are additional metered spaces at the Natcher Plaza. Metered parking (coins only) costs $.50 per 15 minutes, a maximum of $6.00 for 3 hours.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parking fees are in effect from 7:00 A.M. - 7:00 P.M. Monday - Friday, excluding Federal holidays.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Change for parking is available from change machines in the Library and Natcher Building lobbies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Handicapped visitor parking (free) remains in the north side lot next to Building 38 near the handicapped ramp.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Maps of NLM Parking Facilities:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img alt="Maps of NLM Parking Facilities" src="/share/image/nlmprk2.gif" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="/news/nlmpark.html"&gt;Large version&lt;/a&gt; also available)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional map of &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/od/ors/parking/graphics/nihpark.gif"&gt;NIH&amp;#39;s parking facilities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;font color="#FF0000"&gt;AIM will Cease after December 1997 Issue&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s monthly publication, &lt;em&gt;Abridged Index Medicus&lt;/em&gt; (AIM) will cease following the &lt;strong&gt;Volume 28, Number 12, (December 1997)&lt;/strong&gt; issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Abridged Index Medicus&lt;/em&gt; was initiated in 1970 to &amp;#34;afford rapid access to selected biomedical journal literature of immediate interest to the practicing physician&amp;#34; when on-line services were not readily available. A subset of citations from 119 English language clinical journals indexed for Index Medicus was selected for AIM. The publication was of value to the community over the years; at one point, over two thousand libraries, clinics, colleges, and individuals subscribed to the monthly issues and the annual cumulations. During the past 20 years, however, an increasing number of subscribers have been accessing the data from electronic resources, and subscriptions to the printed product have declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online searchers, please note&lt;/strong&gt; that you will still be able to search using A (SB) to limit your retrieval to the journals i n the AIM subset. Even though the printed AIM is being discontinued, the AIM subset list will continue to exist online in ELHILL. PubMed, a non-ELHILL search system, does not currently contain a Subset (SB) field or its equivalent; however, this enhancement will be added to PubMed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since there are many demands on Federal dollars, the National Library of Medicine must make some difficult choices concerning the support of existing products versus the improvement and development of new products. NLM Associate Director for Library Operations, Lois Ann Colaianni, realizes that some find the AIM particularly useful; and she will be happy to explore alternatives for this information with such individuals. She may be contacted via email, &lt;a href="mailto:loisann@nlm.nih.gov"&gt;loisann@nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Lindberg, M.D. &amp;#34;On Halloween eve, its theme is entirely appropriate, of course. But this exhibit explores some of the fundamental questions of all time,&amp;#34; Dr. Lindberg explained. &amp;#34;Why has the public at times feared science? Have changes in communication technology made the public feel close to the center of decision-making regarding science policy? If so, has this allayed their fear of science?&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibit will feature artifacts associated with resuscitating the nearly dead from the early nineteenth century, early efforts at blood transfusion, experiments conducted with &amp;#34;animal electricity,&amp;#34; and other attempts to reanimate dead bodies. Other parts of the exhibition include posters and pacemakers, masks and monsters, comics and cartoons, books and brains, all illustrating the ways in which people have coped with their desires, hopes, and fears of medical science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Frankenstein, the tale of a young man of science who creates a monster by animating human flesh, represents an enduring myth that has gripped our imaginations for almost two hundred years,&amp;#34; said Elizabeth Fee, Ph.D., Chief of NLM&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division. &amp;#34;This exhibition provides a serious historical examination of the many meanings of the Frankenstein legend. It starts with Mary Shelley&amp;#39;s rational but tragic creature who searches vainly for human companionship and explores the different meanings of the celluloid monster of 1930s Hollywood and its continuing echoes in popular culture. We also see this exhibition as an opportunity to recognize some of the social, ethical, and philosophical concerns raised by such scientific endeavors as cloning, xenografting, the Human Genome Project, and other new developments in biomedicine.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susan E. Lederer, Ph.D., Visiting Curator of the exhibition, noted, &amp;#34;Unlike Mary Shelley&amp;#39;s day when access to medical and scientific knowledge was limited to a wealthy and educated elite, today we have unparalleled access to such information through institutions like the National Library of Medicine, through the popular media, and through the World Wide Web. The challenge is how to navigate this ocean of information to educate ourselves about new developments in biomedical science in order to make responsible decisions.&amp;#34; As Mary Shelley long ago explained, we must like Prometheus, &amp;#34;use knowledge as a weapon to defeat evil, by leading mankind, beyond the state where they are sinless through ignorance, to that in which they are virtuous by wisdom.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the exhibition, the Library will host a film series featuring five Frankenstein films (Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, Curse of Frankenstein, Young Frankenstein, Mary Shelley&amp;#39;s Frankenstein) which will be introduced with brief presentations by scholars, scientists, and film critics. The series will run on five consecutive Thursday evenings beginning November 6, 1997.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Press interested in a tour of the exhibit prior to the opening reception may contact the &lt;strong&gt;Public Information Office at (301)496-6308 or email: frankenstein@nlm.nih.gov&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Frankenstein -- Penetrating The Secrets of Nature&amp;#34; can be viewed at the Library Monday Friday, 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. (With extended hours Thursday, till 9:00 p.m.), and Saturday 8:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. The exhibit will run through August 15, 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a id="Images" name="Images"&gt;Exhibit Images and Artifacts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Author Mary Shelley" src="/share/image/frank1.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley&lt;/strong&gt; (1797-1851)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artist: Samuel John Stump (ca. 1783-1863)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Mary Shelley was just 19 years old and the unmarried mother of two&lt;br /&gt; children when she experienced her &amp;#34;waking dream&amp;#34; about a pale student&lt;br /&gt; and the monster he creates, a dream that would become her first novel&lt;br /&gt; Frankenstein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photographic reproduction of an oil painting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phtograph courtesy of Corbis-Bettmann&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Diodati" src="/share/image/frank2.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diodati, The Residence of Lord Byron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artist: W. Purser&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; During the summer of 1816, Lord Byron rented&lt;br /&gt; a villa on the shores of Lake Geneva in&lt;br /&gt; Switzerland. Here he proposed the famous&lt;br /&gt; ghost-story competition that prompted Mary&lt;br /&gt; Shelley to conceive Frankenstein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photographic reproduction of a 1933 steel engraving&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photograph courtesy of The Granger Collection, New York&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Novel" src="/share/image/frank3.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; (published: London, 1818)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author: Mary Shelley (1797-1851)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The London publisher Lackington issued the novel, which&lt;br /&gt; appeared without Mary Shelley&amp;#39;s name, in three volumes.&lt;br /&gt; Most novel sales at the time were made to private lending&lt;br /&gt; libraries, which circulated their books among fee-paying&lt;br /&gt; customers. Thus, a novel printed in three parts could be&lt;br /&gt; loaned to three different patrons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photograph courtesy of the Department of Special Collections,&lt;br /&gt; University of Pennsylvania Libraries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Voltaic Pile" src="/share/image/frank4.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voltaic Pile, French (?), ca. 19th century&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In 1800 Alessandro Volta described the voltaic pile. Constructed&lt;br /&gt; of alternating discs of zinc and copper, with pieces of cardboard&lt;br /&gt; soaked in brine between the metals, the pile produced electrical&lt;br /&gt; current. The metallic conducting arc was used to carry the electricity&lt;br /&gt; over a greater distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bakken (lender)&lt;br /&gt; Photograph courtesy of the National Library of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Illustration from De Viribus" src="/share/image/frank5.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illustration from De Viribus Electricitatis in Motu Musculari&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;(published: Modena, 1742)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author: Luigi Galvani (1737-1798)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Electricity excited much wonder in the eighteenth century.&lt;br /&gt; Italian physician Luigi Galvani described the &amp;#34;constant and&lt;br /&gt; wonderful phenomenon&amp;#34; of the frog&amp;#39;s remote contraction in his&lt;br /&gt; studies of animal electricity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photograph courtesy of the National Library of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A Galvanized Corpse" src="/share/image/frank6.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Galvanized Corpse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artist: Henry R.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;A new bibliography on acupuncture has been prepared in support of a &lt;a href="http://odp.od.nih.gov/consensus/cons/107/107_intro.htm"&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference&lt;/a&gt; on Acupuncture held in Bethesda, MD on November 3-5, 1997. It was compiled to help answer the question of whether, based on the clinical data, acupuncture point therapy is likely to be helpful for a given clinical problem. The bibliography was produced by staff at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) not only for conference attendees but also for physicians, acupuncturists, and others interested in this alternative medicine technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acupuncture&lt;/i&gt; covers the period from January 1970 through October 1997 and contains 2,302 citations to journal articles, books and book chapters, and conference proceedings and papers. Arrangement of the bibliography is primarily by clinical application, such as in the cardiovascular system or for headache. It is a valuable resource because citations were located not only by searching a variety of medical databases, but also by hand-searching the entire collection of the National Library of Medicine for acupuncture journals which are not indexed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acupuncture bibliography is part of NLM&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;Current Bibliographies in Medicine&lt;/i&gt; series and may be obtained free-of-charge from &lt;a href="/pubs/cbm/acupuncture.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/cbm/acupuncture.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The bibliography was produced by staff at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) not only for conference attendees but also for practitioners, researchers, and others interested in the neurobiology of heroin addiction and the safety and efficacy of narcotic (methadone) maintenance treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conference addresses the following key issues in medical treatment for heroin addiction: Overview of opiate agonist treatment and natural history of heroin addiction; Molecular neurobiology and pathogenesis of opiate addiction; Consequences of untreated opiate addiction; Current opiate addiction treatment modalities; Predictors of treatment outcome; and Barriers to the effective use and availability of opiate agonist treatment. The bibliography, &lt;i&gt;Effective Medical Treatment for Heroin Addiction&lt;/i&gt;, is organized according to the key issues of the conference agenda with additional subsections for specific complications of opiate addiction. Citations include journal articles, books and book chapters, hearings, posters, and conference proceedings and papers. The majority of the selected references are from January 1994 to September 1997; selected earlier references provide background for the main topics of the conference. References are in English with the focus on heroin addiction in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heroin bibliography is part of NLM&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;Current Bibliographies in Medicine&lt;/i&gt; series and may be obtained free-of-charge from &lt;a href="/pubs/cbm/heroin_addiction.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/cbm/heroin_addiction.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Readers will now have new information in a more timely manner rather than having to wait for a complete issue to be cumulated and printed to find out about a new feature or other newsworthy information. New articles and Technical Notes will be published electronically as they become available. The November-December 1997 issue will be the last issue printed on paper and mailed to subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Included on this site are all 1997 Web versions of the &lt;em&gt;TB&lt;/em&gt;. A cumulative index for 1979 - 1994 is also available with subsequent years being added in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The URL for the electronic TB is: &lt;a href="/pubs/techbull/tb.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/tb.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;The Legend of Library Operations, Lois Ann Colaianni, Puts Her Career on the Shelf&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4&gt;NLM Associate Director Retires After Nearly 18 Distinguished Years&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lois Ann Colaianni, Associate Director for Library Operations since 1984, retired in December 1998. At the September meeting of the NLM Board of Regents, NLM Director Dr. Donald A.B. Lindberg presented the NLM Director&amp;#39;s Award to Mrs. Colaianni &amp;#34;for exceptional leadership and innovative contributions to the Library&amp;#39;s programs and services during her highly successful tenure as Associate Director for Library Operations, National Library of Medicine.&amp;#34; On the same occasion the Board passed by acclamation a resolution of appreciation acknowledging &amp;#34;...on behalf of the U.S. medical and health communities a debt of gratitude for seventeen years of outstanding service to the National Library of Medicine and its users.&amp;#34; &lt;a href="#Adopted"&gt;(Full text of the resolution follows.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Lois Ann Colaianni" border="3" height="319" hspace="3" src="/news/colaianni.gif" vspace="3" width="250" /&gt; Mrs. Colaianni came to NLM in January 1981 as Deputy Associate Director for Library Operations after serving as the director of libraries for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She became acting associate director in 1982 and was named Associate Director two years later. Library Operations, the oldest and largest of NLM&amp;#39;s components, is responsible for building and preserving the NLM collection; developing the Medical Subject Headings; indexing and cataloging biomedical literature; disseminating NLM&amp;#39;s authoritative bibliographic information online and in machine-readable and printed products; providing reference assistance, customer service, and document delivery; maintaining an active History of Medicine program; managing NLM&amp;#39;s health services research information services; and directing the National Network of Libraries of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her tenure at NLM, Mrs. Colaianni strengthened basic services and improved the flow of medical information to the user community, while also improving the working environment for NLM staff. She led programs to expand NLM&amp;#39;s preservation program, establish an NIH-chartered committee to advise NLM on the selection of literature to be indexed, improve the currency and coverage of Index Medicus and MEDLINE, increase international MEDLARS accessibility, encourage end-user searching, implement DOCLINE throughout the U.S. and Canada, improve outreach to health professionals through the National Network of Libraries of Medicine, re- engineer customer services, and expand the NLM associate program. Most recently she initiated the development of MedlinePlus, NLM&amp;#39;s consumer health information webpages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Colaianni also maintained a strong presence outside of NLM. She represented the Library on the Advisory Committee to the NIH Office of Women&amp;#39;s Health, was a member of the Library of Congress Network Advisory Committee, served on the Board of Directors of the National Information Standards Organization, chaired the Section of Biological and Medical Science Libraries of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), and edited the third volume of the Handbook of Medical Library Practice, 1989.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sherrilynne Fuller, Ph.D., a member of the NLM Board of Regents and director of the Health Science Libraries, University of Washington, views her as &amp;#34;an inspiration to health sciences librarians through her entire career. Her outstanding achievements in a variety of settings from academic to hospital to NLM are a tribute to her breadth of knowledge, dedication and hard work. She will be remembered as a superb role model, mentor and valued friend to hundreds of health sciences librarians in the United States and the world.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Colaianni&amp;#39;s contributions to biomedical librarianship have been recognized with the highest professional awards in her field. In 1995 the Medical Library Association (MLA) presented her with the Marcia C. Noyes Award, which recognizes an individual whose career has resulted in lasting, prominent contributions to health sciences librarianship. In 1976-77, she chaired MLA&amp;#39;s Hospital Libraries Interest Group and was instrumental in its transformation into the Hospital Libraries Section. In 1979-80, she served as president of MLA. Other honors conferred on her include appointment as a Fellow, the Janet Doe Lectureship, the MLA President&amp;#39;s Award, the NIH Director&amp;#39;s Award, the NIH Merit Award and the UCLA Graduate School of Library and Information Science&amp;#39;s first Distinguished Alumnus award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recognition of her career-long interest in international cooperation among medical libraries, Mrs. Colaianni was named winner of the 1995 Award of Honour of the European Association for Health Information and Libraries (EAHIL) -- the first time this award was presented to a non-European. The same year she served as chair of the International Organizing Committee of the 7th International Congress on Medical Librarianship held in Washington. In 1996 she was named an honorary fellow of the Library Association of the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on her retirement, Tony McSean of the British Medical Association called Mrs. Colaianni &amp;#34;the most respected figure in the world of health librarianship, as her international honors testify, and through IFLA and elsewhere her contribution to the wider profession has also been both broad and deep.&amp;#34; McSean characterizes her as &amp;#34;an incomparably dynamic and reliable collaborator.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Colaianni received a BA in biology from the University of Rochester and an MLS from UCLA. After completing the UCLA biomedical library internship program, she participated in one of NLM&amp;#39;s first classes to train MEDLARS searchers. She returned to UCLA to pioneer in implementing decentralized searching of NLM databases and providing health professions with faster turnaround for computer-based health information. As head of Medical Information Communication Services at UCLA from 1968-72, she also pioneered in expanding information services to rural areas. Traveling extensively in southern California, she worked to establish information services in hospitals, develop cooperative networks, and train hospital librarians. This outreach effort was the model on which many subsequent regional medical library programs were based. In 1972 Mrs. Colaianni moved to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center where she served over 6,000 health professionals and provided a model hospital library information service before coming to NLM in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and her husband, Edmund Colaianni, have now returned to southern California. Recruitment is underway for a successor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Duane Arenales, Chief, Technical Services Division, and Betsy Humphreys, Acting Associate Director, Division of Library Operations, for contributing this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="Adopted" name="Adopted"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;by the Board of Regents of the National Library of Medicine September 24, 1998&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHEREAS&lt;/strong&gt; Lois Ann Colaianni has outstanding talents as a leader, manager, and strategic thinker which have enabled the National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s Library Operations Division to meet the challenge of rising service demands, new programs in AIDS, molecular biology, health services research, and outreach to individual health professionals and recently the general public; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHEREAS&lt;/strong&gt; Lois Ann Colaianni has directed the improvement and expansion of the National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s basic services in such critical areas as selection of the literature for MEDLINE and Index Medicus, online bibliographic information, use of the Internet as a dissemination and access mechanism, preservation of the biomedical literature, improved systems for national and international interlibrary lending, management of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine, and education and training of health sciences librarians; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHEREAS&lt;/strong&gt; Lois Ann Colaianni has improved the working environment and professional development opportunities for her staff and colleagues; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHEREAS&lt;/strong&gt; Lois Ann Colaianni has played an important role in the development of health sciences librarianship and biomedical information services in the U.S. and around the world and has been recognized by the highest honors conferred by the Medical Library Association, international library organizations, and the National Institutes of Health; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHEREAS&lt;/strong&gt; Lois Ann Colaianni has dedicated herself to enhancing biomedical information services for the benefit of health care, education, and research;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BE IT RESOLVED&lt;/strong&gt; that the Board of Regents acknowledges on behalf of the U.S. medical and health communities a debt of gratitude to Lois Ann Colaianni for seventeen years of outstanding service to the National Library of Medicine and to the Nation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;On September 23, NLM released its latest version of MedlinePlus. We listened to our users through direct comments, a formal usability study, and site statistics and made changes to help the public find the health information they need the most. The front page &lt;a href="http://medlineplus.gov/"&gt;http://medlineplus.gov&lt;/a&gt;, with its new look, provides the user with more direct links to health topics, the heart of MedlinePlus. Health topics, which include diseases, conditions, wellness issues, are now arranged both by letters of the alphabet and by topic categories, such as &amp;#34;Cancers&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Lungs and breathing.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every topic now also displays links to related topics and categories for easy navigation around the site. For example, if you don&amp;#39;t see what you need on the &amp;#34;Allergy&amp;#34; page, you can directly link to the related topic &amp;#34;Asthma.&amp;#34; Other improvements include direct links from the &amp;#34;sidebar&amp;#34; to lists of &amp;#34;Hospitals/health facilities,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Doctors/dentists&amp;#34; Finally, the new &amp;#34;About MedlinePlus&amp;#34; page includes a message from the Director, the selection guidelines, and how to link your site to MedlinePlus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it includes over 200 health topics, MedlinePlus is still a work in progress, and NLM welcomes your comments. You can submit these through the link at the bottom of every page.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine is pleased to announce a new Web-based resource to help health practitioners, librarians and others identify syndromes in which multiple congenital anomalies are associated with mental retardation. Multiple Congenital Anomaly/Mental Retardation has been developed by Stanley Jablonski in collaboration with the Office of Computer and Communications Systems (OCCS) and the Medical Subject Headings Section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the present time the system includes structured descriptions of approximately 700 out of the 1600-2000 syndromes of congenital abnormalities known to be associated with mental retardation. Additional entries will be added in the future. There is provision for knowledgeable individuals to submit additional entries for eventual inclusion. As a unique aspect of the scope, this system encompasses chromosomal aberrations and x-linked mental retardation characteristics, some of which are not routinely designated in the literature as syndromes, but possess sufficient syndromic characteristics. Information about each syndrome includes synonyms, personalia, OMIM entries, Unified Medical Subject Headings (UMLS) entries, and MeSH terms. The interface has been based on the logic and format of the MeSH browser, also accessible to users from the NLM Web site.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The 2000 Joseph Leiter Lecture will be delivered by Dr. Scott C. Ratzan, Editor-in-Chief, Journal of Health Communication, at 9:45 a.m. on May 17, 2000, in NLM&amp;#39;s Lister Hill Center Auditorium. The lectureship, which honors former NLM Associate Director for Library Operations, Joseph Leiter, Ph.D., is sponsored jointly by the National Library of Medicine and the Medical Library Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to his position with the Journal of Health Communication, Dr. Ratzan has academic affiliations with Yale University, Tufts University, and George Washington University. He recently collaborated with NLM to produce &amp;#34;Health Literacy,&amp;#34; issue 2000-1 in the Current Bibliography in Medicine series, which is available at &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/cbm/hliteracy.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/cbm/hliteracy.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;#39;s lecture is being held in conjunction with the NLM&amp;#39;s Board of Regents meeting at the Library, in Bethesda, Maryland. Staff of the Library and NIH, MLA members, and the public are invited. Refreshments will be served following the lecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following are the title and brief abstract of Dr. Ratzan&amp;#39;s talk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Communication: The Path to Ideal Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With communication technology forging the cornerstone of the new economy, data, information and knowledge are often blurred. Communication can effectively develop a healthier dose of health. Yet, to be effective and advance our ability to promote health, the quality of communication is key for the audience to obtain, interpret and understand health information to make appropriate decisions. The presentation will offer background and strategies for developing quality communication. In particular, we will explore activities that maximize our progress with scientific prowess as we develop and refine the path for ideal health. Finally, potential ideas and actions for advancing health in the 21st Century will be explored with a particular emphasis on harnessing the power of the new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;On Monday, July 17, at approximately 8:00 AM Eastern Time, NLM&amp;#39;s new web-based DOCLINE version 1.0 went live to all National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) libraries. DOCLINE is NLM&amp;#39;s online interlibrary loan request routing and referral system. DOCLINE provides four main functions to its 3,000 participating libraries:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt; 1. DOCUSER - provides directory and interlibrary loan information on NN/LM participating libraries&lt;br /&gt; 2. REQUESTS - allows users to make document requests which are are routed automatically to libraries who report owning the specific year or volume requested.&lt;br /&gt; 3. SERHOLD - provides journal holdings information&lt;br /&gt; 4. Loansome Doc Patron Administration - allows libraries to maintain administrative information on their Loansome Doc users. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new web based DOCLINE system is a key step in NLM&amp;#39;s total systems reinvention effort. Developed at NLM, the system interfaces seamlessly with other NLM products and services including PubMed and the online catalog LocatorPlus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This final launch represents over two years of programming and testing among NLM staff in the Office of Computers and Communications Services (OCCS), Library Operations, and staff in the Regional Medical Libraries of the NN/LM. We are extremely grateful to all testers in the NN/LM for the useful input they provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 17 also marks the end of an era for the mainframe DOCLINE system, running since 1985. On July 14, the Borrow function of the current mainframe based DOCLINE system was permanently removed, and within 20 days, the entire DOCLINE mainframe operation will be shut down.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In May 2000, the National Library of Medicine and the U.S. Government Printing Office signed a Memorandum of Understanding to ensure the permanent accessibility of major NLM electronic publications that also are distributed through the GPO Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) in printed form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDLP has made government publications available to the public for more than 100 years by depositing printed copies in more than 1300 Congressionally designated libraries located throughout the country. Since 1963, libraries with regional depository status have been obligated to retain those copies permanently. This requirement has contributed to space problems in some libraries--especially in those that have accumulated long runs of large publications such as NLM&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;Cumulated Index Medicus&lt;/i&gt;. A parallel development has been growing recognition by NLM and GPO of the need to find ways to ensure permanent access to the increasing number of government publications that are available in electronic form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent discussions by NLM and GPO have resulted in an agreement that NLM will guarantee permanent public access to several online files that contain information also published in print form. GPO has agreed that most depository libraries no longer will be required to retain paper copies. The Memorandum of Understanding spells out the specific responsibilities accepted by NLM and GPO to ensure the integrity and long term availability of NLM&amp;#39;s online publications. The titles currently covered by the agreement include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cumulated Index Medicus (1966 - 2000)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Index Medicus (1960 - 2004)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="list-style: none"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Note: Earlier years will be included as NLM&amp;#39;s OLDMEDLINE project progresses.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medical Subject Headings (1966 - present)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NLM Catalog (1955-1965)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NLM Catalog. Supplement [microform] (1985-1993)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;National Library of Medicine Audiovisuals Catalog (1978-1993)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;National Library of Medicine AVLINE Catalog (1975-1976)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;National Library of Medicine Current Catalog (1966-1993)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content of these publications are available in NLM&amp;#39;s online files MEDLINE, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), and LocatorPlus. Depository Libraries that are planning to withdraw printed copies must follow regular GPO procedures. Questions should be directed to GPO&amp;#39;s Federal Depository Library Program staff.&lt;/p&gt;

In July 2000, OLDMEDLINE added some 220,582 citations from the 1958-1959 Current List of Medical Literature (CLML).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OLDMEDLINE, available free to searchers on the Web via Internet Grateful Med, was launched in December 1996, with over 307,000 citations originally published in the 1964 and 1965 Cumulated Index Medicus (CIM). Since then, OLDMEDLINE has been expanded to include citations that extend the database&amp;#39;s reach further into the past. Plans are underway to add citations from 1955-1957 in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEDLINE, NLM&amp;#39;s popular database containing more than 11 million journal references from around the world, includes medical literature indexed from 1966 forward.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;When the National Library of Medicine endeavored to modernize its computer systems in the late 1990s/early 2000s, the NLM chose XML (eXtensible Markup Language) as the new tagged format for disseminating its MEDLINE bibliographic citation data. A DTD (Document Type Definition) defines the structure of this XML. This is the only distribution format for MEDLINE data created beginning with the 2001 production year. The suite of DTDs used for MEDLINE/PubMed data are available at &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/dtd/"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/dtd/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This decision strengthens NLM&amp;#39;s commitment to distribute its journal citation data in a format that is widely described and, therefore, familiar to many in the information industry, especially in the Internet Web environment. XML lends itself to human readability as well as to easy machine manipulation. In its transition to XML, NLM took the opportunity to examine the MEDLINE unit record and make organizational data changes such as moving information that enhances the article title (e.g., errata and retraction information) into separate elements and providing for new elements such as a corporate author name. Changes have been made to the DTDs as needed, usually on an annual basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing XML as the data format was a natural extension of NLM&amp;#39;s use of XML to &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/publisher.html"&gt;receive bibliographic data electronically from publishers&lt;/a&gt;. XML also supports &lt;a href="/databases/dtd/medline_characters.html"&gt;UNICODE&lt;/a&gt;, a universal character set that permits NLM to continue to use selected diacritical marks, an important consideration for the worldwide nature of MEDLINE data. NLM is using the UTF-8 encoding form of UNICODE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the availability of MEDLINE in XML, NLM also produces an XML version of the following:&lt;br /&gt;1. its controlled vocabulary Medical Subject HeadingsÂ® (MeSHÂ®), a companion information resource for MEDLINE,&lt;br /&gt;2. its monographic and serial data which is also available in MARC21 (USMARC) and&lt;br /&gt;3. its toxicological and environmental health data.&lt;br /&gt;Links to those DTDs are also available at &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/dtd/"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/dtd/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of XML at NLM also is part of other products and services such as in the behind-the-scenes programming for the NLM Gateway, a search tool that upon one request from a user, queries several back-end retrieval systems operational at NLM. The current MEDLINE Data Creation and Maintenance System (DCMS) is another example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legacy MEDLINE database was ported from a proprietary database on an IBM mainframe to a commercially available relational database product on UNIX. The application to create and maintain MEDLINE citations is a web-based application that uses dynamic generation of html from the database. NLM uses XML files with a DTD for input/output files to/from the MEDLINE database. NLM&amp;#39;s current approach to XML generation from the database uses a C program written by NLM that generates DTD-compliant XML. Input to the database also uses a program written in C and makes use of an XML parser for C to parse the input XML file.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The Washington, D.C. area has a rich medical history with many of its medical institutions originating in the 19th century. Now history buffs can &amp;#34;tour&amp;#34; many of these places online by clicking on &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/medtour/intro.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/medtour/intro.html&lt;/a&gt;. The tour of 30 sites was prepared by Inci A. Bowman, Ph.D., a retired medical librarian in Washington, D.C. NLM hosts the tour on its History of Medicine website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the facilities of historical medical interest are still in existence, such as the Clara Barton National Historical Site in Glen Echo, Maryland. Other spots on the cyber-tour include lesser known sites such as Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary Museum in downtown Alexandria which opened in 1792 and operated continuously until 1933. Past customers included George Washington and Robert E. Lee. It now operates as a museum and has a collection of more than 8,000 objects including pill rollers, drug mills, and journals and letters. Both of these institutions have their own web sites, and there are links to them from the cyber-tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many wounded Civil War soldiers were housed in the Washington, D.C. area. And many of these medical facilities &amp;#34;exist&amp;#34; only on the cyber-tour. For instance, the Lincoln General Hospital opened in December 1862 to care for the tremendous number of Civil War casualties. At its busiest, the hospital complex included 20 pavilions and 25 tent wards. Taken down after the Civil War, the area once occupied by Lincoln General Hospital, is now a residential district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the largest Civil War hospitals was the Armory Square located where the present National Air and Space Museum stands today. The 1,000-bed hospital had 12 pavilions, overflow tents, and spread out across the Washington Mall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A handy area map is also provided to aid you in your tour.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;NLM Funds 16 AIDS Information Community Outreach Projects in September 2001 in the Eighth Round of the Program&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM has continued its HIV/AIDS- related outreach efforts to community-based organizations, patient advocacy groups, faith- based organizations, departments of health, and libraries. This program provides support to design local programs for improving information access for AIDS patients and the affected community as well as their caregivers. Emphasis is on providing information or access in a way meaningful to the target community. Projects must involve one or more of the following information access categories: information retrieval, skills development, Internet access, resource development, and document access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Awards were made for the following projects:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Project 2000 (Washington, D.C.)&lt;/b&gt; PROJECT 2000 and Hine Junior High School will team together to offer HIV/AIDS training to select staff and students who will then serve as trainers for Hine students and parents, and students and parents in the PROJECT 2000 community. Participants will learn how to search the web for information on HIV/AIDS, using the website developed with previous NLM funding. A computer lab in PROJECT 2000 House (set up during the previous NLM project), a study center located in the Woodland Terrace Housing Project in Ward 8 in southeast Washington, DC will serve to further community exposure to HIV/AIDS awareness. This site will be open to parents and community members on designated week nights and weekends during the course of the proposal. Students themselves will be responsible for the development and maintenance of the website. Project 2000 on the web: &lt;a href="http://www.project2000inc.org"&gt;http://www.project2000inc.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The AIDS Library (Philadelphia, PA)&lt;/b&gt; Building on the previous programs funded by NLM the AIDS Library will expand its services. The earlier funding from NLM enabled the AIDS Library to purchase six computers, develop four tutorials on accessing information and develop specialized web pages. The web pages included a low-literacy treatment page with important information about treatment options and services as well as links to related sites and a Living with HIV page with practical information for individuals who are managing their disease. This new project will target inner city people living with HIV, especially people of color-the most impacted group in Philadelphia. Through presentations, training, tutorials, and culturally sensitive low literacy material, the project will facilitate increased access and information utilization that allows people with HIV to live healthier and more productive lives. The AIDS Library on the web: &lt;a href="http://www.aidslibrary.org"&gt;http://www.aidslibrary.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Public Health Seattle and King County HIV/AIDS Program (Seattle, WA)&lt;/b&gt; The HIV/AIDS Program of Public Health-Seattle and King County (PHSKC) will work with community- based organizations in King County to improve access to HIV/AIDS related information for patients, affected communities and their caregivers. They will partner with Management Information Services of Public Health-Seattle and King County and the CBOs to provide computer technical assistance to CBOs in King County that serve communities of color and provide training and information skills development to people of color and staff of CBOs in King County. The HIV/AIDS Program of Public Health-Seattle and King County on the web: &lt;a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/health/apu/"&gt;http://www.metrokc.gov/health/apu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;New Mexico AIDS InfoNet (Albuquerque, NM)&lt;/b&gt; The New Mexico AIDS InfoNet is an online HIV/AIDS information resource, providing Fact Sheets on treatment and related information in non- technical language, in English and Spanish. In addition, the web site includes a categorized listing of more than 500 HIV/AIDS web site addresses. The InfoNet materials receive over 100,00 page views each month. Over 45% of these visits are from outside the United States. This funding will support ongoing maintenance of the existing Fact Sheet collection and development of selected additional topics. In collaboration with the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Library, the InfoNet web site will be publicized to audiences of public librarians and medical librarians, and the project will provide access to HIV/Aids journal articles for New Mexicans living with HIV and their health care providers. The Project will also offer training in the use of the Internet and of the InfoNet web site to HIV/AIDS case managers and clients within New Mexico and at selected national AIDS conferences. New Mexico AIDS InfoNet on the web: &lt;a href="http://www.aidsinfonet.org/"&gt;http://www.aidsinfonet.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One Day At a Time, Positive Effects Outreach Ministry and The AIDS Library (Philadelphia, PA)&lt;/b&gt; Positive Effect Outreach Ministry (PEOM), and One Day At a Time (ODAAT) each have storefront outreach programs in heavily impacted Philadelphia Neighborhoods. These multipurpose storefront sites make a range of HIV services available to neighborhoods that include people with AIDS/HIV and many extremely at risk for HIV, included people already infected who are unaware of their status. Services on site included counseling and testing, primary care clinics, case management, housing assistance and referrals. Through this project PEOM and ODAAT will join with the AIDS Library to increase access to information for people with HIV/AIDS, and AIDS service staff by installing computers in two storefront sites in the Kensington and Northeast Philadelphia sections of the city. These computers will form the core of mini-computer centers and AIDS Library branches to enable those using the storefront to find up to date, comprehensive, and literacy appropriate information through the Internet and the World Wide Web. The AIDS Library will provide guidance and training for the above groups as well as developing a special web site for users to link to, and will have staff available to assist ODAAT and PEOM staff as they guide consumers through the wealth of information available on the World Wide Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AIDS Education Global Information System (AEGIS)&lt;/b&gt; This funding will support one staff person who will be a content assistant to Sr. Mary Elizabeth, Operations Director of the AEGiS Website. This will assist in archiving of the constantly growing HIV/AIDS news and research body of knowledge. In addition, it will assist AEGiS in the linking of research documentation to NLM&amp;#39;s PubMed abstract database. This will enable patients and researchers of HIV/AIDS to get to original source material very quickly. AEGiS is presently serving over 500,000 user sessions per month. It has archived over 700,000 documents dealing with HIV/AIDS. The sources for this information are the National Library of Medicine and many other government agencies, and AIDS service organization publications, and Wire services. All of this data is archived and is word searchable. Now with this new feature many articles&amp;#39; footnotes will be linked so that original material is located easily on PubMed. AEGIS on the web: &lt;a href="http://www.aegis.org"&gt;http://www.aegis.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welch Medical Library, Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD)&lt;/b&gt; The Johns Hopkins Welch Library and Maternity Center East (MCE), a community-based primary care clinic serving poor, uninsured women of East Baltimore, will supplement and enhance its existing HIV/AIDS screening and counseling services by purchasing computers and offering current, accurate information on local and relevant national AIDS/HIV resources in a web-based format enhanced by audio- recordings of the healthcare providers and the women served by the clinic. The goal of the project is to provide accurate, current information, in a way that enhances confidence in the resources and overcomes barriers to understanding the textual presentation of the information. Clinicians of MCE will record descriptions of the resources. The women who use the resources will be invited to describe their experience using the resources, and recordings of both the testimonials and clinician&amp;#39;s descriptions will be clustered on the wed page near the textual description of the resource. Both health professionals of the clinic and the women served by the clinic will be trained in basic computer skills enabling them to use the web page and audio recordings. The effect of audio on resource utilization will be tested by randomly assigning clients into two groups: those who use the web page of resources and those who use a web page of resources enhanced with audio. Welch Medical Library on the web: &lt;a href="http://www.welch.jhu.edu/"&gt;http://www.welch.jhu.edu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Southwest Georgia Area Health Education Center (Albany GA)&lt;/b&gt; Southwest Georgia Area Health Education Center (SOWEFA-AHEC) will assess and significantly expand HIV/AIDS resource awareness specific to the residents of the 38 counties of southwest Georgia. After a baseline survey undertaken by meeting with representatives of the affected community (defined in this proposal as all individuals who are directly affected by the AIDS pandemic, particularly those who are infected with the disease or are the primary caregiver for somebody who is infected with the disease), the project will develop and market a web site, conduct hands-on training at eight southwest Georgia population centers, and the distribute printed materials. They will focus on how and where to find reliable information (both print and electronic) on all facets of the AIDS pandemic including but not limited to current trends in treatment, medication, financial resources, clinical trials, legal aid, medical research, and transmission statistics; and what and where AIDS resources are available in southwest Georgia.

(Omaha, NE)&lt;/b&gt; Nebraska AIDS Project (NAP) will improve access to electronic HIV/AIDS information resources for the clients, staff, volunteers, and the community-at-large in metro- Omaha by establishing a computer lab networked with high-speed Internet access. NAP will develop state-of-the art information resources specifically targeting metro-Omaha, Nebraska, and Southwest Iowa residents with rich, multimedia educational web content and links to authoritative HIV/AIDS websites. NAP will improve the ability of people with HIV/AIDS and caregivers to access state-of-the- art information resources hosted on or linked to the NAP website by providing Computer Clinics aimed at developing basic computer skills, exploring web applications and multimedia content, and troubleshooting technical issues. The Nebraska AIDS Project on the web: http://www.nap.org/home.html&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Critical Path AIDS Project (Philadelphia, PA)&lt;/b&gt; Since its founding in 1989 by the late Kiyoshi Kuromiya, Critical Path AIDS Project has developed a complementary and diverse suite of information services, designed by a person with AIDS for persons with AIDS and their caregivers, available nowhere else in the United States. The project began with a print newsletter and later BBS but expanded in 1995 to become an Internet Service Provider (ISP), bring dial-up access, email and the World Wide to low income people in Philadelphia affected by the ADSI epidemic. Critical Path AIDS Project request funding to provide people living with HIV?AIDS access to the rich information resources on the Internet. The Critical Path AIDS Project will maintain service on the Critical Path system as an Internet Service Provider; upgrade our electronic mailing list software to allow more sophisticated uses of email lists at all levels of Internet literacy; and redesign the Critical Path Web by Critical Path AIDS Project to the 215,267, and 445 area codes that serve Philadelphia, Bucks, and Montgomery counties.

The CFA&amp;#39;s information center houses the largest collection of HIV/AIDS-specific literature in this part of the country. The objectives of this project include: developing three training curricula and pilot test and refine them; obtain equipment for the training; and conduct training sessions to assist clients and providers in developing their skills. Center for AIDS on the web: &lt;a href="http://www.centerforaids.org/"&gt;http://www.centerforaids.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Germantown Settlement and the AIDS Library (Philadelphia, PA)&lt;/b&gt; The project will create a Community Access Computer Center and HIV Resource Center (CCRC) in the Germantown Philadelphia offices of WISDOM/Germantown Settlement. This is a community-based organization that provides services to people with HIV. Using the experience developed in the current programs of the AIDS Library previously funded by NLM, this project will take the resources of the AIDS Library into the community by establishing a satellite location in the Germantown section of Philadelphia. Staff and community representatives will be training the use of computes as well as in the use of the Internet to gather HIV-related health information. The AIDS Library&amp;#39;s collections will be made available by training local staff and referring more complicated questions to the Library. This project will specifically target low-income women of color living with HIV and women with a history of drug and alcohol abuse that puts them at high risk for HIV infection. The Germantown settlement is an established community center and the location of the CCRC there will provide a supportive environment for information access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Center for Human Development (Pleasant Hill, CA)&lt;/b&gt; The Empowerment Program, a service of the Center for Human Development, submits this request for quotation for the creation of an Empowerment Internet Cafe. The proposed project of the Empowerment Program will provide Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Transgender and Questioning Youth (LGBTQ) in Contra Costa County, CA, access to current and reliable on- line education on the social, emotional, and medical issues surrounding HIV/AIDS. It will also give them access to computers in an accepting atmosphere. This project will first offer online training to peer educators and then, through them, expand the training to other LGBTQ youth. As the training grows, so will the ability of the target population to be educated about HIV/AIDS. A web-site for the project will also be developed so youth who utilize the Empowerment Program&amp;#39;s drop-in services and youth who have access to a computer elsewhere can get current information that will be posted by trained peer-editors and professional staff. The goal of the Empowerment Cafe is to reduce the growing number of HIV/AIDS cases among youth in Contra Costa Country. Center for Human Development on the web: http://www.chd-prevention.org/empowerment/index.htm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stonewall Alliance Center (Chico, CA)&lt;/b&gt; This project will provide greater access to information regarding HIV/AIDS and other men&amp;#39;s health issues to a rural area of northern California. This audience in rural areas presents unique challenges to HIV prevention workers and care providers. The Momentum Education Network will expand the ability of both the providers as well as the affected population to access needed information. The project includes (1) provider Internet access to online health databases; (2) a portal page for linking online databases to the Stonewall Alliance Center web page; (3) development of a database of area HIV service providers; (4) documents distribution and reference to the public through the Stonewall Alliance Center&amp;#39;s Harlen Adams Memorial Library; and (5) promotion of these services and materials to the public.

(Washington, DC)&lt;/b&gt; This organization provides a residential substance abuse treatment program and drop in center targeted to homeless and recently incarcerated men and women who have multiple diagnoses, e.g., mental illness, a history of substance abuse and HIV/AIDS. These locations afford SHOM the opportunity to provide extensive training in the use of and access to the NLM&amp;#39;s MedlinePlus and other medical information resource via the Internet. The training program will train clients who participate in the residential program and who will, in turn, serve as peer trainers and system monitors for other residential clients and those visiting the drop in center. Safe Haven Outreach Ministry on the web: http://members.aol.com/cdgrandi/shom/index.htm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metro TeenAIDS (Washington, DC)&lt;/b&gt; This organization works to prevent HIV among youth and is the leader in the Washington, DC region in bringing the message of HIV/AIDS prevention to the Youth Centers. Through existing &amp;#34;Internet Cafes&amp;#34; located at MTA&amp;#39;s three Youth Centers, we will establish an electronic resource program for youth that is both youth oriented and informative. MTA will establish a training program designed to equip the staff and peer educators with knowledge about using the Internet and accessing HIV/AIDS related information. The staff and peer educators will, in turn, train the target audience (youth ages 13- 24) and enable them to be confident and competent in utilizing the Internet to research HIV/AIDS related information. Additionally, MTA will distribute flyers and palm cards encouraging youth to use their facilities to access Internet databases on HIV/AIDS information.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Since 1996, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) has made Internet Connection grants to health-related institutions that wish to provide Internet access to the professionals and clients of their organization. The latest awards are listed below. They will benefit health professionals, scientists and citizens in 24 states in the U.S. and in eight countries in Central Asia, Africa and the South Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Internet has become an essential infrastructure in the health environment. It provides an abundance of resources such as: communication services including electronic mail and discussion groups; direct access to scientific and health-related information resources, including digital libraries, MEDLINE via PubMed, a host of federal and private sector databases; direct telehealth services; and access to supercomputers and remote scientific sensing instruments. NLM encourages all kinds and types of health institutions to use the Internet to gain access to these vast and rich resources, and to one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM&amp;#39;s Internet Connection program was created in recognition that many health- related organizations, particularly smaller ones and those in rural or urban health-underserved areas, lack resources to initiate Internet access or to enhance low-bandwidth dial-up connectivity. The NLM Internet Connection grant supports the purchase and installation of equipment and services for connectivity to the Internet for one year. The 100th NLM Internet Connection grant was awarded earlier this year. Awardees may use the grant to initiate Internet service, to extend service to other centers or field locations, or to expand the bandwidth of their existing service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr align="center" /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;List of Awardees&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alaska Dept of Health and Social Services, Juneau, AK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Project Title:&lt;/b&gt; Internet Connection of Rural Public Health Centers. &lt;b&gt;Performance Sites:&lt;/b&gt; Kodiak, Haines, Tok, Delta Junction, Dillingham, Craig, AK &lt;b&gt;Project Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Connect 6 most remote public health centers to the statewide WAN and train public health nurses to use the resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SeaView Community Services, Seward, AK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Project Title:&lt;/b&gt; SeaView community services rural internet connection &lt;b&gt;Performance Sites:&lt;/b&gt; SeaView Community Services, Assisted Living Home, Seward AK &lt;b&gt;Project Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Internet access for clinicians, clients, administrators at 2 sites; nearest medical library 120 miles away at U of Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center, Phoenix, AZ&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Project Title:&lt;/b&gt; Internet Connectivity for Oncology Research in Rural Arizona Communities &lt;b&gt;Performance Sites:&lt;/b&gt; Greater Phoenix Community Clinical Oncology Program, Phoenix, AZ &lt;b&gt;Project Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Outreach to rural communities.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#34; &amp;#39;I Swear by Apollo Physician&amp;#39;: Greek Medicine from the Gods to Galen&amp;#34;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The History of Medicine Division of the National Library of Medicine has installed an exhibition on Classical Greek medicine titled, &amp;#34; &amp;#39;I swear by Apollo Physician&amp;#39;: Greek Medicine from the Gods to Galen.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is on display outside the Division&amp;#39;s Reading Room until April 26, 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibition focuses on the history of Greek medicine and Classical Greek contributions to modern medicine. Included in the exhibition are items from the Library&amp;#39;s history of medicine collection, among which are early printed editions and medieval manuscripts of works by physicians such as Hippocrates, Galen, Artemidorus, Aristotle, and Dioscorides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many foundations of modern Western medicine lie in Classical Greece, from about 800 B.C.E. to about 200 C.E. During this period Greek medicine departed from the divine and mystical and moved toward observation and logical reasoning. These ideas spread throughout the Mediterranean world and as far east as India, and their influence has remained strong in much of the West to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine is at 8600 Rockville Pike, on the grounds of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. The Library is open 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday; 8:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. on Thursday; and 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. on Saturday. Because of heightened security, parking at the NIH is difficult. Go to &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/visitor.html"&gt;www.nlm.nih.gov/about/visitor.html&lt;/a&gt; for directions and information about security measures.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is experiencing delays in the publication of &lt;em&gt;Index Medicus&lt;/em&gt; and the 2002 &lt;em&gt;List of Journals Indexed in Index Medicus (LJI)&lt;/em&gt; which is usually shipped with the January issue of &lt;em&gt;Index Medicus&lt;/em&gt;. NLM recently implemented a new data creation and maintenance system which references the data that are included in both of these publications. This has necessitated changes in the programs that produce them and the development of new procedures for ensuring that both are accurate and complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The December 2001 &lt;em&gt;Index Medicus&lt;/em&gt; is the first issue to be produced using the new software. The layout of the publication has been preserved to the extent possible, but users may notice a slight variation in the placement of data or use of punctuation. NLM expects that subscribers should receive the December issue in late January 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subscribers to &lt;em&gt;LJI&lt;/em&gt; will receive their copy with a forthcoming monthly shipment of &lt;em&gt;Index Medicus&lt;/em&gt;. The January and February 2002 issues of &lt;em&gt;Index Medicus&lt;/em&gt; are expected to be delivered in February 2002. Changes and improvements made to &lt;em&gt;Index Medicus&lt;/em&gt; will be detailed in the 2002 preface. NLM regrets the inconvenience caused by these delays, but expects to return to the normal production schedule with the February &lt;em&gt;Index Medicus&lt;/em&gt; issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Like it or not, the American public has had to school itself in recent months about anthrax, smallpox and other instruments of biological warfare. Now, a new website at the National Library of Medicine culls the best resources on the topic and makes them available at no charge to computer users everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site, located under &amp;#34;Special Topics&amp;#34; at &lt;a href="http://www.sis.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;www.sis.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;, features a short description of biological warfare in general. It then examines eight specific agents: anthrax, botulism, brucellosis, bubonic plague, Q fever, smallpox, tularemia and viral hemorrhagic fevers. Under these subheads, users will find descriptions of transmission, symptoms and treatment of the diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also links to online resources at the National Library of Medicine (such as the MEDLINE, MedlinePlus and TOXLINE databases), plus those compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the U.S. Army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Division&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;Biological Warfare&amp;#34; site includes references to recent journal articles on the topic, all part of the NLM collection and available via interlibrary loan. This timely site concludes with a listing of public and private Internet resources on the general topic of biological warfare, and selected online resources in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine is at 8600 Rockville Pike, on the grounds of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. The Library is open 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday; 8:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. on Thursday; and 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. on Saturday.

From pesticides in schools and playgrounds to nitrates in the water, children are at increased risk for a variety of adverse health effects such as developmental delays and asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To point health officials towards the resources that can help them address these problems, NLM will join with other agencies and associations to produce a live satellite broadcast, &amp;#34;Children&amp;#39;s Environmental Health Information Resources.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1997 Presidential Executive Order on the Protection of Children to Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks states that each Federal agency shall make it a high priority to identify and assess risks posed to children by the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access to information is vital for understanding environmental hazards and ensuring the safety of children. There are numerous resources on the World Wide Web that address the environmental health risks of children, however it often is difficult to locate and identify high quality, accurate, and authoritative sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This live interactive program will demonstrate selected online resources in the context of important children&amp;#39;s environmental health issues. Topics include pesticide exposure, environmental triggers of asthma, and lead poisoning prevention funding resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broadcast is a production of the Partnership for Information Access for Public Health Professionals, a joint venture of public health agencies and associations, including the National Library of Medicine, the National Network of Libraries of Medicine, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This program is just one of many ways the Partnership actively assists public health departments in accessing information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To learn more about the Partnership, please go to: &lt;a href="http://nnlm.gov/partners"&gt;http://nnlm.gov/partners&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For more information on the satellite broadcast, please see: &lt;a href="http://www.phppo.cdc.gov/PHTN/child-env/"&gt;http://www.phppo.cdc.gov/PHTN/child-env/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The History of Medicine Division (HMD) Reading Room at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) will be closed for renovation March 21-March 29, 2002. During that time, there will be no stack service for HMD materials (pre-1871 journals, pre-1914 monographs, modern manuscripts, and historical audiovisuals). HMD items on microfilm can be requested from the Main Reading Room, which will be open as usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the renovation, HMD will continue normal interlibrary loan operations, e-mail reference (hmdref@nlm.nih.gov), and telephone reference (301-402-8878), though you may reach voicemail rather than a person. Staff will return phone calls as promptly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staff members expect the HMD Reading Room to resume normal operations the first week in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For NLM Visitor and Research Information, please see: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/visitor.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/visitor.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;May 7, 2002 is the fourth annual World Asthma Day. Recognizing that asthma remains a prevalent disease and a major public health problem in the United States and throughout the world, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will mark the day by debuting and demonstrating NLM&amp;#39;s novel new virtual DVD exhibit on asthma, &amp;#34;&lt;em&gt;Breath of Life&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faced with widespread public interest in its 6,000 square foot exhibition on asthma that closed recently on the National Institutes of Health campus, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) decided to take the exhibit on the road -- with a high-tech twist. The complete exhibit was put on a DVD disk, using the latest technology pioneered by the NLM. Anyone with a DVD player and a computer equipped with a DVD-ROM drive can now view the exhibit. The disc contains more than two hours of full-screen, full-motion video, graphics, audio, and animations, as well as open captioning for the hearing impaired. Now everyone can &amp;#34;tour&amp;#34; the &lt;em&gt;Breath of Life&lt;/em&gt; exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contents of the &lt;em&gt;Breath of Life&lt;/em&gt; DVD are lively and varied. We hear three-time Olympic gold medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee describe her experiences with asthma. We delve into the history of asthma, learning how therapies have evolved through the years. (Incredibly, tobacco, cocaine and opium were once popular asthma treatments.) We watch what happens to the lungs during an asthma attack and learn how to use an inhaler correctly. We follow the experiences of a young girl with asthma, and see its effects on her and her family. We learn about asthma research trends. &lt;strong&gt;To view a five-minute overview of the DVD, click on one of the links to the right of the &lt;em&gt;Breath of Life&lt;/em&gt; image.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border="0" summary="layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img alt="Breath of Life DVD logo" border="0" height="67" src="/news/breath.gif" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;&lt;a href="/news/breathoflife44.mov"&gt;QuickTime 44 kbps (for modem)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="/news/breathoflife250.mov"&gt;QuickTime 250 kbps (for DSL, cable and faster)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Asthma can be managed properly only when the patient and his family understand the nature of this disease,&amp;#34; notes Donald A.B. Lindberg, M.D., director of the National Library of Medicine. &amp;#34;Now everyone, including asthma patients, parents, health professionals, and teachers, can learn more about asthma in an entertaining and informal way, in the comfort of their own home, office or school.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The DVD exhibition will make its debut at the CDC Museum Auditorium, Roybal Campus, 1600 Clifton Road, in Atlanta, Georgia. Martha Katz, CDC&amp;#39;s Deputy Director for Policy, and Richard J. Jackson, MD, Director of CDC&amp;#39;s National Center for Environmental Health, will demonstrate this unique technology at CDC&amp;#39;s -- Tuesday, May 7, 2002 at 10:30 a.m. -- World Asthma Day ceremonies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To view enlarged photographs of the May 7th World Asthma Day ceremonies, click on the photographs below to open them in a new window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border="0" class="layout-table-noborder" summary="layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="160"&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:openwin1()"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ms. Martha Katz and Dr. Richard Jackson" border="0" height="130" hspace="5" src="katz_jacksonT.jpg" width="150" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a href="katz_jackson2.jpg" target="_blank" title="Ms. Martha Katz and Dr. Richard Jackson"&gt;Link to use if javascript is disabled.

Can they see parallels to hot-button topics like cloning and stem cell research in her classic tale? What are Shelley&amp;#39;s and their own views about personal and societal responsibility as these relate to science and other areas of life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the exhibition, participating libraries will host interpretive and educational programs to help audiences discuss Shelley&amp;#39;s novel and its use of scientific experimentation as a metaphor for cultural values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibition and related materials were developed by the NLM and the American Library Association, and funded by a major grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out if the exhibition is coming to your area, go to the &lt;i&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/i&gt; exhibition homepage, which includes a list of participating libraries: &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/publicprograms/frankenstein/"&gt;http://www.ala.org/publicprograms/frankenstein/&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

In response to the confirmed need for future leadership, the NLM/AAHSL Leadership Fellows Program is focused on preparing emerging leaders in academic health sciences libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellows will have the opportunity to develop their knowledge and skills in a variety of learning settings, including exposure to leadership in a new environment. They will be paired with mentors who are academic health sciences library directors. The Program takes advantage of flexible scheduling and an online learning community to allow fellows to maintain their professional and personal lives. NLM will provide financial support for up to five fellows and will underwrite travel expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Program Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one-year Program design is multi-faceted: three in-person Leadership Institutes held in conjunction with national meetings; attendance at Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) annual meetings; a fellow/mentor relationship; three web-based courses on issues related to effective library leadership and management; and a two-week site visit to the mentorÃ¢ÂÂs home library (in one or two-week segments).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Program is designed to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduce emerging academic health sciences leaders to leadership theory and practical tools for implementing change at organizational and professional levels;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop professional relationships between fellows and current directors through mentoring partnerships;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expose fellows to another academic health sciences library under the guidance of their mentors;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a cohort of learners who will draw upon each other for support throughout their careers; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Offer recognition to emerging leaders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM/AAHSL Leadership Fellows Program is now accepting applications for the September 6, 2002, deadline, from potential fellows and mentors for the initial 2002-2003 experience. Candidates for fellow should have a minimum of five years of department head level or equivalent experience in an academic health sciences library, hospital library, or other library-related setting. Mentors should have at least five years experience as director of an academic health sciences library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete Program information, including Program design, schedule, and application criteria, is available online at &lt;a href="http:///"&gt;http://www.arl.org/olms/fellows/&lt;/a&gt;.

Seating is on a first come first served basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;6:30 P.M., Thursday, October 17, 2002&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fantastic Voyage&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (director Richard Fleischer, 1966, 100 minutes, PG)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fantastic Voyage&lt;/i&gt; is the original psychedelic inner-space adventure. When a brilliant scientist falls into a coma with an inoperable blood clot in the brain, a surgical team embarks on a top-secret journey to the center of the mind in a high-tech military submarine shrunk to microbial dimensions. The anatomical body turns into a dream world: scuba-diving surgeons battle white blood cells, tap the lungs to replenish their oxygen supply, and shoot the aorta like daredevil surfers. Starring Stephen Boyd and Raquel Welch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;6:30 P.M., Thursday, October 24, 2002&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Osmosis Jones&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (directors Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly, 2001, 96 minutes, PG)&lt;br /&gt; About two-thirds animation and one-third live action, &lt;i&gt;Osmosis Jones&lt;/i&gt; is a cop movie spoof set inside the human body. The title character is a street-smart white blood cell, working as an agent for the immune system. He and Drix, an over-the-counter cold capsule, are reluctant partners fighting what appears to be a minor infection in a character named Frank (Bill Murray). Osmosis discovers that Frank has really contracted a fatal virus, Thrax. He battles a corrupt body politic led by a venal mayor to save Frank&amp;#39;s life and win the affection of the mayor&amp;#39;s aide, Leah. Starring Bill Murray, Chris Rock, David Hyde Pierce, Laurence Fishburne, and William Shatner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;12:30 P.M., Thursday, October 31, 2002&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (director Charles Barton, 1948, 83 minutes, NR)&lt;br /&gt; A sharply written parody of 1930s horror films, &lt;i&gt;Abbott and Costello Meet&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/i&gt; is a tale of two baggage handlers--Chick Young (Bud Abbott) and Wilbur Grey (Lou Costello)--who undertake to transport corpses. However, when they receive coffins purporting to contain the remains of both Count Dracula and Frankenstein&amp;#39;s monster, trouble is on its way. Starring Bud Abbott, Lou Costello and BÃÂ©la Lugosi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;6:30 P.M., Thursday, November 7, 2002&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gross Anatomy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (director Thom Eberhardt, 1989, 109 minutes, PG-13)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gross Anatomy&lt;/i&gt; is a comedy drama about an independent, freewheeling med student enrolled in the toughest course in the curriculum--Gross Anatomy. With his style at odds with everything around him, he must prove himself to a demanding professor and a lab partner who won&amp;#39;t let anything interfere with her plans--not even the fact that he&amp;#39;s fallen in love with her. Starring Matthew Modine, Christine Lahti and Daphne Zuniga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;6:30 P.M., Thursday, November 14, 2002&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Innerspace&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (director Joe Dante, 1987, 120 minutes, PG)&lt;br /&gt; This clever comedy about a miniaturization experiment stars Martin Short as a hypochondriac, Dennis Quaid as a miniaturized test pilot who is accidentally injected into him, and Meg Ryan as an investigative reporter who is the test pilot&amp;#39;s girlfriend. Ryan and Short try to defeat bad guys who want to steal the miniaturization technology as Quaid travels through the complicated systems of the human body. Starring Dennis Quaid and Martin Short.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;NLM Funds 15 AIDS Information Community Outreach Projects in September 2002 in the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Round of the Program&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"&gt;NLM has continued its HIV/AIDS-related outreach efforts to community-based organizations, patient advocacy groups, faith-based organizations, departments of health, and libraries. This program provides support to design local programs for improving information access for AIDS patients and the affected community as well as their caregivers. Emphasis is on providing information or access in a way meaningful to the target community. Projects must involve one or more of the following information access categories: information retrieval, skills development, Internet access, resource development, and document access.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"&gt;Awards were made for the following projects:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"&gt;AID Atlanta, Inc. - &lt;em&gt;AIDS Information Outreach Project: Using the Internet to Enhance Access to Information&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/span&gt; (Atlanta, GA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"&gt;The goals of the AIDS Information Outreach Project include improving delivery of HIV/AIDS health information to AID Atlanta clients who are infected or affected by HIV/AIDS, and creating a new and/or expanded source of information for AID Atlanta&amp;#39;s clients, Case Managers, Health Educators, and the general public.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/span&gt; AID Atlanta will create a new website and implement a Client Resource Room where clients can be trained to access information and resources via the Internet.

Founded in 1989 by the late Kiyoshi Kuromiya, the project began with a print newsletter and later BBS but expanded in 1995 to become an Internet Service Provider (ISP) bringing dial-up access, email, and the World Wide Web to low income people in Philadelphia affected by the AIDS epidemic. The funding of the project will help build on the current Internet services provided by Critical Path AIDS Project to the 215 and 267 area codes that serve Philadelphia, Bucks, and Montgomery counties and the 856 area code serving Southern New Jersey.

The youth group will create a pamphlet/magazine and a resource directory of websites with HIV/AIDS information attractive to young people. The informational pamphlets will be distributed to youth audiences attending Project Reach Youth, Inc.&amp;#39;s educational presentations, theatre performances, and street outreach activities. The websites will be added to Project Reach Youth, Inc.&amp;#39;s website and the information for this website will be distributed to the local libraries in Brooklyn and New York.

Because of the limited materials currently available in the UAF Resource Library, the staff often refers visitors to the Spencer Eccles Health Sciences Library. This project proposes to digitally connect the resources of the Utah AIDS Foundation (UAF) Resource Library and the Spencer Eccles Health Sciences Library, and create an easy-to-use compilation of existing highly regarded HIV/AIDS and other health related online information resources, both national and local. Therefore, staff and faculty of both locations, students visiting either sites, and community individuals affected by HIV/AIDS will be able to access these collections via either facility, and also search for local information and resources through the compilation of online resources which will be available on the UAF Resource Library&amp;#39;s website.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) announces 52 awards in its new Internet Access to Digital Libraries (IADL) grant program. The purpose of the IADL grants is to help health-related organizations provide consumers, health professionals and health staff with access to digital health information resources and information services of the highest quality. These projects will use computers linked to the Internet to give access to published articles and books, electronic health records, curriculum materials and scientific knowledge bases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FY 2002 IADL awards, amounting to just over $4 million, will reach consumers and health professionals in more than 330 communities in 25 states and Puerto Rico. Forty percent of the recipient organizations serve rural populations; 17% are in inner-city settings. Twenty-eight percent of the projects benefit minority populations and people with special health needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM recognizes that many health-related organizations, especially smaller ones and those in rural or inner-city settings, lack resources to take full advantage of the InternetÃ¢ÂÂs ability to facilitate informed decision making by health professionals and consumers. The IADL grants help such organizations use the Internet for access to health related information and services provided by NLM and others; to transfer files and images, and to interact by e-mail and videoconferencing with colleagues throughout the world. The grants emphasize the delivery of health information to end-users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information about funded awards is available at &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/AwardsIADL.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/AwardsIADL.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Questions about the program should be directed to Dr. Valerie Florance, 301-594-4882; e-mail address: &lt;a href="mailto:florancev@mail.nih.gov"&gt;florancev@mail.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Since 1998, MedlinePlus has provided the public with up-to-date, authoritative health information on a broad national scale. But on January 14, 2003, at a ceremony at the Pittsboro Public Library, MedlinePlus &amp;#34;went local&amp;#34; for the citizens of North Carolina and it now provides health information from local and state resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new site, billed as &amp;#34;A Web Resource of Local Health Information for North Carolinians,&amp;#34; is at http://www.nchealthinfo.org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) Health Sciences Library and School of Information and Library Science have created NC Health Info to address local health questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where does a support group for Alzheimer&amp;#39;s caregivers meet in Charlotte?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it safe to eat the fish I catch in Pamlico Sound?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where can I get a rubella vaccination in Siler City?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there an exercise class for breast cancer survivors in Chapel Hill?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a support group in Vance County for adolescents with substance abuse problems?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are there any dentists in Hyde County?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;NC Health Info provides answers to these and other questions through links to Web sites from hospitals, physicians, nursing homes, support groups, health screening clinics and many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find local services, MedlinePlus users (&lt;a href="http://medlineplus.gov/"&gt;http://medlineplus.gov&lt;/a&gt;) first select the &amp;#34;Go Local&amp;#34; link from any health topic, choose a North Carolina county or city, and then browse a list of Web links to services. Going the other way, NC Health Info users can find health information related to local services through links to MedlinePlus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNC staff have developed and tested methods to identify, select, and organize these health services Web sites. The experience gained and documentation created by the NC Health Info pilot will benefit future &amp;#34;Go local&amp;#34; initiatives in creating successful Web sites to bring local health services information to MedlinePlus users in other states.&lt;/p&gt;

The photographs are on display from FebruaryÂ 3 toÂ February 28Â in the lobby of the Library&amp;#39;s Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications (Building 38A on the National Institutes of Health campus).Â Â &lt;/font&gt; &lt;a href="/news/schom03poster.jpg"&gt;See exhibition poster.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman, Times"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invoking the Spirit--Worship Traditions in the African World&lt;/em&gt;Â is an exhibition of photographs by New York Times photojournalist Chester Higgins, Jr. The product of more than 25 years of travel and research, this photographic essay documents the vitality and diversity of the global African religious experience.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman, Times"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invoking the Spirit&lt;/em&gt;Â is organized around a series of themes that explore worship practices across ethnic, cultural, and religious boundaries throughout the African world. Documented in this exhibition are the kinds of sacred places African peoples--in Africa and the America--create or consecrate; the diverse spiritual leaders who are involved in conducting worship activities; the universal use of prayer as a formal means of communicating with God and the spirits; the ceremonies Africans use to pay tribute to God; and the roles of music and dance in religious ceremonies.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman, Times"&gt;The images presented here have been selected from Higgins&amp;#39;s archive of almost a million photographs that document the broader global African experience.

We received feedback from many users telling us that they&amp;#39;d like to have a dictionary added to our collection of online health information.&amp;#34; Nearly 2 million unique visitors access MedlinePlus each month; they view over 15 million content pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;We&amp;#39;re delighted to begin this relationship with MedlinePlus and the National Library of Medicine,&amp;#34; said John M. Morse, President and Publisher of Merriam-Webster Inc. &amp;#34;&lt;em&gt;Merriam-Webster&amp;#39;s Medical Desk Dictionary&lt;/em&gt; introduced a new concept in medical dictionaries, and we welcome the opportunity to introduce one of our finest reference products to a broader audience.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary&lt;/em&gt; contains definitions for 60,000 words and phrases used by health- care professionals.

CFA is a barrier-free camp working in partnership with organizations to enrich the lives of children and adults with chronic illnesses and disabilities and their families by providing camping and retreat experiences. Internet-connected workstations will be placed at CFA&amp;#39;s health center. The CFA staff will be trained on locating and using electronic health information resources. The CFA staff will support the information needs of the Camp For All Campers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr align="center" /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Utah&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;University of Utah&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Spencer S.

Project staff will locate qualified narrators to read aloud approximately 200 multilingual health publications already available online in a visual, pdf format. These 200 pdf documents are available through the 24 Languages Project (&amp;#60;&amp;#60;A href=&amp;#34;http://medstat.med.utah.edu/24languages&amp;#34; /&amp;#62;http://medstat.med.utah.edu/24languages&amp;#62;). These readings will be recorded, digitized, and prepared for Web-based availability, adjacent to the existing pdf documents. Listeners would access the recordings through the project&amp;#39;s Web site. The project&amp;#39;s expected outcome would be access to health information for the visually impaired and individuals with literacy deficits in English or a native language, both regionally and worldwide. It would provide previously inaccessible information to a very large audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr align="center" /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Virginia&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Edward-Via-Virginia College of Osteopathic Medicine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Blacksburg, VA&lt;br /&gt; Project Director: Bruce Dubin&lt;br /&gt; Phone: 540-443-9106; FAX: 540-443-9119&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:bdubin@evvcom.org"&gt;bdubin@evvcom.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Virginia College of Osteopathic Medicine plans to increase access to health information and improve health literacy for underserved regions in Appalachia.

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;A symposium at the National Library of Medicine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with the &lt;i&gt;Dream Anatomy&lt;/i&gt; exhibition, the National Library of Medicine is hosting &lt;i&gt;Visionary Anatomies&lt;/i&gt;, a half-day symposium. Anatomical show- manship goes back to anatomy&amp;#39;s origins as a scientific discipline. Today, a revival of anatomical spectacle in fine art, science exhibitions, popular films and television shows has sparked new debates about the meaning, uses, ethics and history of anatomical display and representation. &lt;i&gt;Visionary Anatomies&lt;/i&gt; will bring together anatomists, cultural historians, physicians, museum professionals, and historians of medicine and science to discuss the art and science of anatomy from the 1500s to the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;TIME:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Thursday, June 12, 2003, 2:00-8:00pm&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLACE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Lister Hill Auditorium, National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health 8600 Rockville Pike, Bldg. 38A Bethesda, MD 20894&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;PARTICIPANTS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;F.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Just as special populations have special health needs, they have special health information needs. The National Library of Medicine has created a Web site aimed at the health needs of Asian Americans, one of the fastest growing minority populations (currently 11 million) in the U.S. The site, &amp;#34;Asian American Health,&amp;#34; is atÂ &lt;a href="http://asianamericanhealth.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://asianamericanhealth.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asian Americans are exceedingly diverse, coming from nearly 50 countries and ethnic groups, each with distinct cultures, traditions, and histories. They speak many languages and dialects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Asian Americans in the United States suffer from many of the same health problems as the population at large, certain diseases predominate. For example, there is a particularly high rate of liver cancer among Asian Americans and lung cancer is their leading cause of cancer death. Vietnamese women&amp;#39;s cervical cancer rate is five times higher than Caucasian women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;There is a wealth of reliable health information in this site that Asian Americans will find useful for themselves and their families,&amp;#34; said Donald A.B. Lindberg, M.D., director of the National Library of Medicine. &amp;#34;The Web allows us to make it available free and with no registration or other strings attached,&amp;#34; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asian American Health is the second Web site that the National Library of Medicine has created for special populations. The first, ArcticHealth, was launched in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

The Journal Publishing DTD (&lt;a href="http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/publishing"&gt;http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/publishing&lt;/a&gt;) and the Archiving and Interchange DTD (&lt;a href="http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;) were both created from the Archiving and Interchange Tagset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Publishing DTD defines a common format for the creation of journal content in XML. The Archiving DTD also defines journal articles, but it has a more open structure; it is less strict about required elements and their order. The Archiving DTD defines a target content model for the conversion of any sensibly structured journal article and provides a common format in which publishers, aggregators, and archives can exchange journal content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DTDs were created after collaboration between the Harvard University E-Journal Archiving Project and NCBI. This collaboration was inspired by Inera Inc.&amp;#39;s (&lt;a href="http://www.inera.com/"&gt;http://www.inera.com&lt;/a&gt;) &amp;#34;E-Journal Archival DTD Feasibility Study&amp;#34; (&lt;a href="http://www.diglib.org/preserve/hadtdfs.pdf"&gt;http://www.diglib.org/preserve/hadtdfs.pdf&lt;/a&gt;) . Harvard and Inera&amp;#39;s participation was supported by the Mellon Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mulberry Technologies (&lt;a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/"&gt;http://www.mulberrytech.com&lt;/a&gt;) and Inera examined thousands of articles from hundreds of journals to be sure that the content models being defined were comprehensive. After this extensive modeling, the consultants worked with NCBI to create the Archiving and Interchange DTD, then NCBI and Mulberry created the Journal Publishing DTD to help publishers who had not yet selected a format for their electronic content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DTDs may be used as is, or the Tagset can be used to construct other DTDs. These DTDs and the Tagset are in the public domain. Complete information and documentation can be found at &lt;a href="http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The NCBI contact for the DTDs is Jeff Beck (telephone 301-435-5992; fax 301-480- 0109).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine has one of the richest collections of illustrated anatomical books in the world. Now, for the first time, the general public can take a peek at these books dating from the fifteenth century to the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Library&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division announces &lt;strong&gt;Historical Anatomies on the Web&lt;/strong&gt;, a new digital project that broadens access to this collection by providing high-resolution, downloadable scans of important images. The web site is: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/historicalanatomies/home.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/historicalanatomies/home.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Historical Anatomies on the Web&lt;/strong&gt; offers selected images from NLM&amp;#39;s anatomical books, with an emphasis on images and not texts. Books and images are selected primarily for their historical and artistic significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to produce the highest quality images, the pages of the atlases have been scanned at a high resolution, which will allow users to employ them in any number of projects, including close examination and comparisons, publications, presentations, and artwork. The images are also presented in a format that allows zooming and panning at high magnification. High-resolution TIFF files will be archived and made available to researchers as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each image is accompanied by a brief historical discussion about the work, its author, the artists, and illustration technique. A bibliographical description is also included, so that users will know exactly which edition is being used and if there are any characteristics special to NLM&amp;#39;s copy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Historical Anatomies on the Web&lt;/strong&gt; so far includes 120 images from five anatomical books by Andreas Vesalius, Johannes de Ketham, Magnus Hundt, Albrecht DÃ¼rer, and Bernardino Genga. Images from nearly 20 other anatomical works will be added in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The NLM Visitors Center has had a complete makeover and is back in business. The facility, on the first floor on NIH Building 38A (the Lister Hill Center), has been enlarged and redecorated, and will soon feature new interactive displays highlighting NLM programs and services. With an exciting 12-minute video, &amp;#34;Expanding the Medical Universe,&amp;#34; a high-definition projection system and state-of-the-art sound system, the popular interactive attraction &amp;#34;Turning the Pages&amp;#34; and other features, the NLM tours are better than ever. Guests are welcome to join the 1:30 public tours, conducted each weekday except federal holidays. The one-hour presentation features a walking tour that includes the computer room, reading room, exhibition space and History of Medicine Division, in addition to the videotape and a demonstration of NLM databases.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just Ask Cosmo&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) receives hundreds of e-mailed questions each day on its customer service line (&lt;a href="http://apps.nlm.nih.gov/mainweb/siebel/nlm/index.cfm"&gt;custserv@nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;). Because many of them are simple and asked numerous times each day, NLM decided to develop software that would answer these queries and thus free up customer service representatives and reference librarians to answer more complex questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on software from a company called NativeMinds, Cosmo (Customerservice M. Owl) the wise old owl was the result. Available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, Cosmo nests at &lt;a href="http://wwwns.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://wwwns.nlm.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt;. Cosmo is familiar with hundreds of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). Type your question in the box and up pops an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to get directions to the Library? Find out about parking? Just ask Cosmo. Want to know how to find older medical journal articles? Ask Cosmo. Cosmo can also tell you how to participate in a clinical trial, answer a brief question about the Library&amp;#39;s history, and give you a list of all of NLM&amp;#39;s databases. He can also refer users to the basic health information found in MedlinePlus and respond to drug-related questions with MedlinePlus drug information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM staff will constantly review the conversation logs and Cosmo will get smarter over time as his base of knowledge grows and becomes adaptable to new questions. This is one smart owl!&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;NLM Funds 16 AIDS Community Information Outreach Projects in September 2003 in the 10th Round of the Program&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM has continued its HIV/AIDS- related outreach efforts to community- based organizations, patient advocacy groups, faith- based organizations, departments of health, and libraries. This program provides support to design local programs for improving information access for AIDS patients and the affected community as well as their caregivers. Emphasis is on providing information or access in a way meaningful to the target community. Projects must involve one or more of the following information access categories: information retrieval, skills development, Internet access, resource development, and document access. Awards were made for the following projects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Standard Award Projects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AIDS Education Global Information System (AEGiS) (San Clemente, CA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AEGiS seeks funding from NLM to assist in providing HIV/AIDS information to patients, the affected community, researchers and caregivers. AEGiS will accomplish this goal by maintaining two content assistants who will support Sr. Mary Elizabeth, the Operations Director of the AEGiS Website. Funding will also assist AEGiS in the linking of research documentation to NLM&amp;#39;S PubMed abstract database. AEGiS is presently serving over 735,000 users per month, and has archived over 1.1 million documents dealing with HIV/AIDS. The sources for this information are the NLM and many other government agencies, AIDS Service Organization publications, and Wire services (Associated Press, BBC, Inter Press Service, Reuters, Wall Street Journal, Agence Presse France, etc.). All of this data is archived and is keyword searchable. With this new feature, many articles&amp;#39; footnotes will be linked so that original material is located easily on PubMed. The AIDS Education Global Information System (AEGiS) on the web: &lt;a href="http://www.aegis.org/"&gt;http://www.aegis.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium-&amp;#34;Community Drum&amp;#34;-An Alaska Native/Rural Alaska AIDS Information Community Outreach Project (Anchorage, Alaska)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC) is the largest tribal health care organization in the United States, formed in December 1997 to manage the statewide health services component of the Alaska Native health care system. The purpose of this project is to improve education and information access to quality HIV/AIDS information and to establish an online community for Alaskan Native HIV/AIDS patients, affected family members, and the community. This project will provide a means for Alaskan Native HIV/AIDS patients to form a continuing support network through communication with other Alaskan Natives and families coping with similar diseases. This consortium will provide an Alaskan Native informational website for use by HIV+ Alaska Natives and rural Alaskans including a message board and links to other credible HIV/AIDS website resources, create a web-based CD for use by clients without Internet access and for distribution to regional health organizations, and develop a database of area HIV/AIDS service providers and resource centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Center for AIDS: Hope &amp;#38; Remembrance Project-Project AIR 2003 (Houston, TX)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Center for AIDS (CFA) is a nonprofit, community-based organization that provides treatment and research information to people with HIV/AIDS and service providers in Houston and Harris County. Project AIR 2003 is an expansion and updating of an outreach program previously funded by NLM in 2001, to teach clients and service providers how to obtain objective and accurate information about HIV/AIDS research and treatment options. The Project AIR 2003 will expand previously created curricula to provide updated HIV-specific treatment information as well as internet based training. The curricula will be taught to 30 groups of historically underserved patients and minority service providers. This project will also link participants to the CFA storefront information center where they can apply their skills using the CFA&amp;#39;s computer workstations and the Internet to access current treatment information.

Founded in 1989 by the late Kiyoshi Kuromiya, the project began with a print newsletter and later BBS but expanded in 1995 to become an Internet Service Provider (ISP) bringing dial-up access, email, and the World Wide Web to low income people in Philadelphia affected by the AIDS epidemic. The Critical Paths AIDS Project will maintain service on the Critical Path system, as an Internet Service Provider, providing security for all users with the installation of server based virus software. The funding of the project will help build on the current Internet services provided by Critical Path AIDS Project to the 215 and 267 area codes that serve Philadelphia, Bucks, and Montgomery counties and the 856 area code serving Southern New Jersey.

In addition, the web site includes a hyperlinked, categorized listing of more than 500 HIV/AIDS web site addresses to facilitate individual research. Although originally designed to serve the HIV community in New Mexico, the InfoNet has grown into a national and international resource. Also, the InfoNet materials receive nearly 300,000 &amp;#34;page views&amp;#34; each month, including significant visits from outside the United States. Funding from NLM will support the ongoing maintenance of the existing fact sheet collection and development of selected additional topics. In collaboration with the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Library, the InfoNet web site will be publicized to audiences of public librarians and medical librarians. This project will also offer presentations on HIV/AIDS treatment topics within New Mexico and at selected regional or national conferences.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, NIH, is co-sponsoring a 2-day symposium on November 5-6Â  that will explore the library as a physical place in a digital world. The symposium will be held in the Library&amp;#39;s Lister Hill Center Auditorium, Building 38A on the NIH campus in Bethesda,Â  Md. NLM is co-sponsoring the Symposium with the Association ofÂ Academic Health Science Librarians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of opinions on just what should be the role library in the 21st century. Is it primarily a physical place? Has the virtual world of the Web replaced it? The spectrum of opinion will be aired in a panel discussion on the first morning. Other topics related to the &amp;#34;Library as Place&amp;#34; will be addressed in panel sessions, poster presentations, and exhibits. Presenters represent academia, the library community, industry, research laboratories, and architects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keynote speakers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congressman Bill Young (R-FL) (Invited)--What Libraries Mean to America&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Timothy Hunt, Imperial Cancer Research Fund and 2001 Nobelist--The Library as Place: Thoughts of a Scholar and Researcher&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the symposium is fully subscribed, members of the press may still register by getting in touch with Kathy Cravedi, 301-496-6308, &lt;a href="mailto:kathleen_cravedi@nlm.nih.gov"&gt;kathleen_cravedi@nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also information about the Symposium on the Web at http://www.tech-res-intl.com/NLM/.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;To celebrate African American History Month, 2004, the National Library of Medicine has on exhibit a collection of photographs from the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. The photographs are on display from February 2 to February 27 in the lobby of the Library&amp;#39;s Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications (Building 38A on the National Institutes of Health campus).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unprecedented exhibition of photographs by journalist Margaret Courtney-Clarke pays tribute to living African artistic traditions that have been passed down through women. Created over a period of more than twenty years, the photographs in this exhibition comprise a survey of the entire corpus of Courtney-Clarke&amp;#39;s documentary journeys in rural South, West and North Africa. These stunning images pay homage to the beauty that rural African women-as artists and entrepreneurs-create in their daily lives for themselves, their families and their communities, often in the face of ongoing social, political and economic challenges, disruption and upheaval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margaret Courtney-Clarke, who was born and raised in Namibia, introduced this body of work in her books: Ndebele, African Canvas and Imazighen. The photographs in this exhibition present a range of African interior and exterior housing design, pottery, textiles, beadwork, personal adornment and other decorative arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the fourth year that the National Library of Medicine has featured photographs from the Schomburg collection. Visitors to the National Library of Medicine (on the campus of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland) are reminded that heightened security measures are in effect. Information about these is at &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/about/visitorsecurity.htm"&gt;http://www.nih.gov/about/visitorsecurity.htm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;MedlinePlusÂ® Goes Local With&lt;br /&gt;Missouri Community Connection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missourians have a new way to connect to local health services. The National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s MedlinePlus consumer health web site now includes Go Local links to Missouri&amp;#39;s Community Connection (http://communityconnection.org) online services directory. The Go Local links bring users of MedlinePlus health topic pages to related health services throughout Missouri and link Missourians directly to authoritative, reliable health information from the National Institutes of Health and other quality sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this new Go Local link, adult children concerned about a Missouri parent&amp;#39;s Alzheimer &amp;#39;s disease can find information about the condition in MedlinePlus and then find listings of services near where their parent lives. A Missouri patient can learn more about a recent cancer diagnosis from MedlinePlus and find local support groups or volunteer organizations willing to help. And, a Missouri parent finding day care services through Community Connection can learn more about childhood development and illnesses on MedlinePlus. These patients and families will all benefit from the Go Local links between MedlinePlus and Community Connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;It is a great step in bridging the gap between the health information we provide nationally and local health services in Missouri, observed Donald A. B. Lindberg, M.D., Director of the National Library of Medicine. &amp;#34;Because I was at the University of Missouri for some 20 years before becoming director of the National Library of Medicine, it is a special pleasure for me to support the fine work done at the University in developing the &amp;#34;Go Local&amp;#34; site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community Connection is a free, statewide directory of more than 17,000 community resources, nearly 5,000 of which are health-related, dynamically linked to the World Wide Web. Community Connection&amp;#39;s powerful search engine permits users to search by topics, organization, geographic regions, networks and more. In addition, it provides links to useful information that helps in evaluating and choosing those resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A special feature of Community Connection Go Local is the &amp;#34;Ask A Librarian&amp;#34; service from the J. Otto Lottes Health Science Library at the University of Missouri-Columbia. This link brings Missourians the services of expert information professionals in answering their questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Missouri Go Local Project is a partnership of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine-Midcontinental Region, Missouri Foundation for Health, and the University of Missouri-Columbia, including MU Extension, the Office of Social and Economic Data Analysis, the J. Otto Lottes Health Science Library, and Health Management and Informatics program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information visit &amp;#34;Go Local&amp;#34; - A Project of MedlinePlus (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/golocal.html).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact:&lt;/strong&gt; Kathleen Cravedi, NLM (301-496-6308) or email: cravedik@mail.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/p&gt;

Curated by John Rees, Associate Curator of Archives and Modern Manuscripts, it is replete with letters, photographs and awards, and can be viewed weekdays except federal holidays from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM and Saturdays from 8:30 AM to 12:30 PM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisenberg came to Washington and Georgetown University after more than 15 years at the University of Pennsylvania, where he built its acclaimed Health Services Research program while simultaneously becoming the first section chief in general internal medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1997, Eisenberg became head of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the government&amp;#39;s counterpart to academic HSR. He held this position for five years, until his death from a brain tumor March 10, 2002. Eisenberg combined a unique sense of society and politics with clinical medicine to become a leader in the field of HSR. As a leader of institutions and mentor to scholars, he guided his field of expertise into a powerful force for understanding the economics of health care. AHRQ had suffered mightily during Clinton-era political wrangling, but Eisenberg helped return AHRQ to its traditional role of supplying non-partisan research to our lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The John M. Eisenberg Papers are in the History of Medicine Division&amp;#39;s Modern Manuscripts Collection. Their acquisition and processing were made possible through the efforts of the History of Health Services Research Project, a joint effort of HMD and NLM&amp;#39;s National Information Center on Health Services Research and Health Care Technology (NICHSR).&lt;/p&gt;

All projects will last up to eighteen months. Funding for the projects was provided through the National Network of Libraries of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Arizona&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Verde Valley Medical Center&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Cottonwood, AZ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Project Directors: Karen Fanning &amp;#38; Jay Fleishman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;The purpose of this project is to provide access to accurate and quality consumer health information to the residents of the Verde Valley and Yavapai County through the Internet. MEDLINE, PubMed, MedlinePlus, NIH SeniorHealth, ClinicalTrials.gov and Household Products Database will be the primary databases used for accessing consumer health information. The target groups and partners in the project are the public library system, medical and mental health car providers, and organizations that provide health services to the uninsured, under-insured, working poor and migrant populations of the Verde Valley. It is anticipated that this project will provide free accurate and quality consumer health information, including easy-to-read material, Spanish and possibly other language materials and interactive tutorials to the Verde Valley and the communities located in Yavapai County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Arkansas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Fort Smith Public Library&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Fort Smith, AR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Project Director: Jennifer Goodson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;The purpose of this project is to combine teaching and training expertise with cutting edge technology to bring health information and health information seeking skills to consumers, health professionals, and library staff members in the greater Fort Smith, Arkansas community. The project establishes a new partnership between the Fort Smith Public Library and St. Edward Mercy Medical Center. The project involves teaching health care consumers, health professionals, and library staff members how to search the Internet for reliable and authoritative health information and demonstrating and teaching the use of NLM electronic health information products including MedlinePlus, Clinicaltrials.gov, ToxTown, and PubMed, among others. In most cases, training will be done at one of four Fort Smith Public Library locations utilizing a mobile computer lab created by the combination of a wireless high speed Internet network and 15 wireless-enabled notebook computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;b&gt;California&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Pacific College of Oriental Medicine (PCOM)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;San Diego, CA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Project Director: Naomi C.

As a result, churches and Muslim based organizations/mosques will increase their technology capacity and skills to access and provide health and wellness resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Sno-Isle Regional Library &amp;#38; Whidbey Island Hospital Foundation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Marysville &amp;#38; Coupeville, WA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Project Directors: Chari McRill &amp;#38; Alexandria Louden&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Electronic Access for Reliable Health and Medical Information Project&lt;/i&gt; will provide the residents of Island County, Washington, electronic access to credible health information and community resources through a partnership between Sno-Isle Libraries, a regional public library system, and Whidbey General Hospital. It is the intent of this project to connect patients, their families, health care professionals, and the general public with the resources needed to answer their health questions in a timely, reliable and confidential manner. The two Medical Resources sites at Whidbey General Hospital will be linked directly with the Library DistrictÃ¢ÂÂs reference librarian and health related databases. Training in locating and understanding consumer health information will be offered to health care professionals, Sno-Isle library staff and senior centers and support groups sponsored by Whidbey General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Thirteen prints by Francisco Goya (1746-1828) , a Spanish painter who stands among the first modern artists, are on display at the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Goya held a position as court painter to Spain&amp;#39;s King Charles IV, he often mocked the powerful in his paintings and satirized Spain&amp;#39;s government and church. His depictions of hospital patients, torture chambers, the poor, and people in complex psychological states, transformed the unmentionable into fit subjects for art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the works are first editions created by Goya, while the others are &amp;#34;restrikes&amp;#34; printed by others using Goya&amp;#39;s original plates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exhibition, on display from September 20, 2004 through October 29, 2004, is curated by Belle Waring of the Prints and Photographs Collection of the History of Medicine Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine is located at 8600 Rockville Pike in Bethesda, MD and is near the Medical Center stop on Metro&amp;#39;s Red Line. The Library&amp;#39;s hours are 8:30 am to 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday and 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Saturday. The exhibition is inside the History of Medicine Reading Room.

ChemIDplus gives detailed information on every chemical discussed in MEDLINE/PubMed medical journals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent survey, users requested more chemical property information. In response, many CHEMIDplus records now provide boiling point, melting point, solubility, molecular weight, and other data. In addition, ChemIDplus users can now search for chemicals by their range of effects, by toxicity, and by the organs/body systems they may act on (such as nervous system, skin, heart, kidneys and liver). ChemIDplus also helps users draw a chemical structure, and search for other chemicals with similar structures. Details about the recently added data and guidance for searching it are provided (&lt;a href="http://chem.sis.nlm.nih.gov/chemidplus/documentation/help/chemidfs2webAdvanced.jsp"&gt; http://chem.sis.nlm.nih.gov/chemidplus/documentation/help/chemidfs2webAdvanced.jsp&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions about ChemIDplus can be sent to NLM&amp;#39;s Specialized Information Services Division mailto:&lt;a href="mailto:tehip@teh.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;tehip@teh.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In just six short years, MedlinePlus, the consumer health Web site introduced by the National Library of Medicine on October 22, 1998, has become one of the Web&amp;#39;s most popular destinations for reliable health information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MedlinePlus provides free access to health information created by the National Institutes of Health and other trustworthy sources. Health science librarians in the National Network of Libraries of Medicine not only assist in identifying and evaluating the information to be included in MedlinePlus, but are of tremendous help in demonstrating the system locally and publicizing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growth of MedlinePlus (and MedlinePlus en espaÃ±ol, introduced in 2002) has been impressive. Today, nearly five and half million people a month from around the world visit the site, viewing over 52 million pages. This is in startling contrast to 1998 when MedlinePlus received about 53,000 visitors in its first quarter of existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newspaper reporters are increasingly depending on &lt;a href="http://medlineplus.gov/"&gt;MedlinePlus&lt;/a&gt;, at http://medlineplus.gov/, as an authority for health information for their stories. Much welcome publicity is received whenever writers cite MedlinePlus as a source. In addition, physicians now write &amp;#34;prescriptions&amp;#34; advising patients who need further information on a subject to visit the Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The constantly growing MedlinePlus includes nearly 700 health topics, ranging from abdominal pain to yellow fever. In addition, MedlinePlus boasts a hospital guide, a prescription and over-the-counter drug reference guide, a medical encyclopedia, a medical dictionary, and a guide to physicians and dentists. One of the most popular offerings on MedlinePlus is the interactive &amp;#34;health tutorials&amp;#34; that have colorful images and sound. There is also a daily feed of articles from major newspapers on current health topics. Among the useful links in MedlinePlus are &lt;a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/"&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://nihseniorhealth.gov/"&gt;NIHSeniorHealth.gov&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://pubmed.gov/"&gt;PubMed/MEDLINE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In noting the sixth birthday of MedlinePlus, NLM Director Donald A.B. Lindberg, M.D. said, &amp;#34;The success of MedlinePlus is a testimonial to the public&amp;#39;s thirst for health information they can trust. One of the improvements we are now introducing is the &amp;#39;Go Local&amp;#39; service, which links MedlinePlus users to relevant health services in their own city, county, and state. We will continue to expand MedlinePlus and make it ever more relevant to the needs of citizens, patients, and families.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;NLM Funds 20 AIDS Community Information Outreach Projects in September 2004 in the 11th Round of the Program&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM has continued its HIV/AIDS- related outreach efforts to community-based organizations, patient advocacy groups, faith-based organizations, departments of health, and libraries. This program provides support to design local programs for improving information access for AIDS patients and the affected community as well as their caregivers. Emphasis is on providing information or access in a way meaningful to the target community. Projects must involve one or more of the following information access categories: information retrieval, skills development, Internet access, resource development, and document access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awards were made for the following projects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Standard Award Projects&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;AID Atlanta, Inc. - Improving Access to HIV Information for AIDS InfoLine Callers (Atlanta, GA)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;AID Atlanta, Inc. provides a toll-free statewide HIV/AIDS information hotline that supplies information, referrals, crisis/emergency intervention and HIV/AIDS and STI (sexually transmitted infection) information utilizing Internet resources for the information and referrals. The Information Hotline provides callers who lack access to the Internet or computers, or are unaware of how to access appropriate resources, with valuable and potentially life-saving information about HIV transmission, prevention, and testing. The Hotline receives approximately 800 calls monthly and is maintained by qualified, trained staff and volunteers. The goals of the AIDS Community Information Outreach Project include improving and enhancing the operation of the InfoLine and increasing the visibility of this service among high risk targeted populations. The AID Atlanta Inc. on the web: &lt;a href="http://www.aidatlanta.org"&gt;http://www.aidatlanta.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;AIDS Education Global Information System (AEGiS) (San Clemente, CA)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;AEGiS seeks funding from NLM to assist in providing HIV/AIDS information to patients, the affected community, researchers and caregivers. AEGiS will accomplish this goal by maintaining content assistants who will support Sr. Mary Elizabeth, the Operations Director of the AEGiS website. Funding will also assist AEGiS in the linking of research documentation to NLM&amp;#39;S PubMed abstract database. AEGiS is presently serving over 900,000 users per month, and has archived over 1.1 million documents dealing with HIV/AIDS. The sources for this information include the National Library of Medicine and many other government agencies, AIDS Service Organization publications, Wire services (Agence Presse France, Associated Press, Inter Press Service, Reuters, United Press International, etc.), numerous regional news organizations (Bangkok Post, BBC, Mail &amp;#38; Guardian, New Vision, Sunday Times) and local publications (Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Chronicle and Examiner, Newsday, etc). All of this data is archived and is keyword searchable. With this new feature, many articles&amp;#39; footnotes will be linked so that original material is located easily on PubMed. The AIDS Education Global Information System (AEGiS) on the web: &lt;a href="http://www.aegis.org"&gt;http://www.aegis.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;AIDS Resource Center Ohio (ARC Ohio) - GOAL: Greater Ohio AIDS Link (San Clemente, CA)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIDS Resource Center Ohio is a non-profit service and prevention organization serving 31 counties in western and north central Ohio. Project GOAL will provide safe, client-friendly computer information access to the HIV/AIDS affected community and their families in four sites located in Dayton, Toledo, Lima and Mansfield Ohio. Internet/computer access training will be offered at each of the sites. Funding will also enable ARC Ohio to enhance the current website to include updated links to complimentary service providers throughout the area (hospitals, clinics, food pantries, counseling centers, transportation, etc.) and an interactive HIV/AIDS chat room where questions will be answered by qualified case workers and AIDS education specialists. The website will also include an online catalog of the library&amp;#39;s resources. The AIDS Resource Center Ohio on the web: &lt;a href="http://www.arcohio.org"&gt;http://www.arcohio.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;AIDS Taskforce of Greater Cleveland - HEAL (the HIV/AIDS Education Access Library) (Cleveland, OH)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AIDS Taskforce of Greater Cleveland (ATGC), established in 1983, is the oldest AIDS service organization in Ohio. The Taskforce serves as a primary provider in Cleveland of both community based HIV prevention education, and non-medical direct services to people living with HIV and AIDS. Project HEAL plans to develop a library containing books, professional and consumer periodicals, and computerized information along with purchasing 5 private computer stations with Internet access. The Taskforce will also enhance the current website to include an online catalog of the library&amp;#39;s materials and recommended research sites for providers and consumers. The library staff and volunteers will assist library patrons in accessing both printed and electronic information, and provide a weekly newsletter in English and Spanish addressing important HIV/AIDS issues. The AIDS Taskforce of Greater Cleveland on the web: &lt;a href="http://www.aidstaskforce.org"&gt;http://www.aidstaskforce.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Columbus AIDS Task Force - The Resource Library Youth Program (Columbus, OH)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Columbus AIDS Task Force is a community-based organization serving a diverse community of more than 1000 HIV + clients in central Ohio. The purpose of this project is to improve access to HIV/AIDS information for urban youth in central Ohio. CATF will develop a bibliography and distribute to local high school libraries, GLBTQ youth groups, and community-based agencies serving at-risk youth. The CATF resource library will expand its collection to include updated books, videos, and pamphlets that are not easily available to teens. CATF will also provide students and educators with training on accessing HIV/AIDS resources via the Internet. As a result of the project, young people will gain access to culturally appropriate, accurate, and current HIV-related information, and youth educators will gain the training and resources needed to address HIV -related issues of the young people they serve. The Columbus AIDS Task Force on the web: &lt;a href="http://www.catf.net"&gt;http://www.catf.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Germantown Settlement, One Day At A Time, Positive Effect Outreach Ministry, and the AIDS Library - Philadelphia&amp;#39;s Community Information Resource and Referral Centers: An AIDS Outreach Project (Philadelphia, PA)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germantown Settlement, One Day At A Time, Positive Effect Outreach Ministry, and the AIDS Library seek funding from NLM to help alleviate the digital divide in the Philadelphia neighborhoods of Germantown and Kensington. The project will 1) maintain three Community Information and Referral Resources Centers (CIRRC) in Northwest Philadelphia and Kensington with computers and access to the Internet; 2) provide training in computer literacy skills and searching the Internet for AIDS related health information; 3) develop a training course for clients specific to their needs; 4) and use the resources of the AIDS Library for inter-library loan and document delivery for the CIRRC staff to answer HIV-related questions. The AIDS Library on the web: &lt;a href="http://www.aidslibrary.org"&gt;http://www.aidslibrary.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Huston-Tillotson College - The HTC Community Health Empowerment Online Project (Austin, TX)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Huston-Tillotson College, a Historically Black College and University, will build upon its existing campus and community HIV/AIDS outreach work and combine its resources and technological expertise to partner with local community and state HIV/AIDS and related health organizations. The goal of the project is to empower HTC staff, faculty, students, alums, AIDS Service Organizations staff, and community residents in East Austin with health information to improve their health. The HTC Community Health Empowerment Online Project will conduct train-the-trainer sessions led by regional NLM staff for community representatives/Consumer Health Advocates (CHAs). The CHAs will assist consumers and peers in retrieving online HIV/AIDS health information making use of existing computer workstations on campus, in community centers, and a mobile van. Funding will enable the college to update the current website to reflect the community surrounding HTC, and will offer a 1 800 Help Line for assistance in locating online resources.

The New York HIV Mapping Collaborative was formed in response to the need to develop a single, integrated data source containing information about all publicly funded HIV-related services in New York City. The collaborative -- comprised of MHRA, the New York City Department of Mental Health and Hygiene, the New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute, and Columbia University -- has identified and integrated data from a myriad of relevant resources. NLM funding will support MHRA in making the integrated HIV/AIDS services data source available to those affected by HIV/AIDS, HIV/AIDS service providers, and other interested parties via an interactive, searchable, web-based interface. Availability of this free, searchable resource will make it easier for consumers and health care providers to locate specific services in their area.

The NOVAM project will develop and pilot test an interactive internet application designed to improve access to HIV/AIDS related information for African-American and Hispanic youth and young adults in Arlington County, Virginia. NOVAM will enhance the existing Arlington County website for teens (www.getrealnow.net) to include an interactive chat room and HIV/AID related resources. The website will be designed, programmed, and marketed by the teens. NOVAM will also install kiosks in public settings that are frequently accessed by the youth. The project collaborators include: NOVAM; Arlington County Department of Human Service Public Health Division; Arlington County Public Library; Arlington County Department of Parks, Recreation, and Community Resources; Career Center of the Arlington County Public Schools; and Arlington Partnership for Children, Youth, and Families.

In addition, the web site includes a hyperlinked, categorized listing of more than 500 HIV/AIDS web site addresses to facilitate individual research. Although originally designed to serve the HIV community in New Mexico, the InfoNet has grown into a national and international resource. Also, the InfoNet materials receive nearly 300,000 .page views. each month, including significant visits from outside the United States. Funding from NLM will support the ongoing maintenance of the existing fact sheet collection and development of selected additional topics. In collaboration with the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Library, the InfoNet web site will be publicized to audiences of public librarians and medical librarians. This project will also offer presentations on HIV/AIDS treatment topics within New Mexico and at selected regional or national conferences.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;On December 2-3, 2004, the National Library of Medicine is presenting &amp;#34;Symposium on Community-Based Health Information Outreach&amp;#34; to explore new models of health information outreach. Those interested are invited to view the Symposium live via the Internet. The program and instructions for connecting to the broadcast are on the Symposium website at &lt;a href="http://www.nlmoutreachsymposium2004.org/"&gt;http://www.nlmoutreachsymposium2004.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of the symposium is to explore new models of health information outreach that are emerging as technology dramatically changes the abilities of medical and health services libraries to provide resources and services beyond their traditional institutional boundaries. Particular emphasis will be given to consumer health information outreach through community-based organizations. The National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s Strategic Plan to Reduce Health Disparities will be reviewed with special emphasis on NLM&amp;#39;s programs targeting Native Americans.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Within the first few months of the start of the First World War, British army physicians began to see a new and disturbing condition among returning soldiers. Symptoms of this nameless disorder included partial paralysis, convulsive movements, blindness, terrifying dreams and flashbacks, and amnesia. Physicians blamed it on the percussive effect of high explosives-but it soon became clear that the cause was not physical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead it was a psychological disorder resulting from the horrors of this peculiar war, and it soon came to be known as &amp;#34;shell shock.&amp;#34; Soldiers often lived in flooded, rat-infested trenches among the rotting corpses of their fellow soldiers with the sounds of exploding shells nearby and the constant threat of hand grenades being lobbed into their trench by the enemy. Often soldiers lived for days and weeks in these demoralizing conditions; to venture out to &amp;#34;no man&amp;#39;s land&amp;#34;--the terrain between the warring sides--was to invite death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small exhibit shows the effects of shell shock, the conditions that provoked it, and the medical response. Poets Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen who were treated for shell shock (Owen was cured and returned to the front, only to be killed) and fiction from the 1920&amp;#39;s to the 1990&amp;#39;s in which shell shock is depicted are also featured. The exhibit uses World War I artifacts to suggest no man&amp;#39;s land and a trench environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibit also highlights the later manifestations of shell shock syndrome to the Vietnam War and after when the reaction to the extreme stress of war was labeled Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, a disorder now recognized by the American Psychiatric Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, located at 8600 Rockville Pike is accessible from the Medical Center stop on the red line. The Exhibit is open from 8:30 am to 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday, except on holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;HHS&amp;#39;s AIDSinfo is celebrating World AIDS Day 2004 and its second anniversary with a new Web site design. World AIDS day is an annual global event dedicated to remembering the victims of AIDS, learning more about the devastating effects of the disease around the world, and reaffirming the commitment to fight it. The AIDSinfo staff contributes to the battle against HIV/AIDS by offering trustworthy information on research, clinical trials, prevention and treatment via the AIDSinfo Web site and by responding to inquiries by phone, fax, postal and e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new AIDSinfo Web site design features a more intuitive layout and consistent navigation. The colorful design, along with improved search functions, makes the site more accessible and useful for health care providers, researchers, patients, families, and friends. The site is also rich in resources because of the significantly increased number of materials available for viewing online, downloading onto Pocket PC/Palm PDAs, and printing from PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since AIDSinfo began in 2002, the Web site has served 2.3 million visitors and facilitated more than 2 million downloads of federal treatment guidelines. The newest service, Live Help, enables Web site visitors to communicate confidentially with the staff in real time to get assistance with navigating AIDSinfo and National Library of Medicine sites and finding federally approved information on HIV/AIDS treatment, prevention, research and more. Twenty-three AIDSinfo fact sheets for consumers were produced and are readily available on the Web site. In addition to Web site services, English- and Spanish-speaking information specialists responded to over 23,700 inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AIDSinfo Web site is at &lt;a href="http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/"&gt;http://aidsinfo.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Missourians have a new way to connect to local health services. NLM&amp;#39;s MedlinePlus consumer health web site now includes Go Local links to Missouri&amp;#39;s Community Connection (http://communityconnection.org) online services directory. Missouri is the second state, after North Carolina, to complete a Go Local connection with MedlinePlus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MedlinePlus health topic pages now have links to related health services throughout Missouri. With this new Go Local link, an adult child concerned about a parent&amp;#39;s Alzheimer &amp;#39;s disease can find information about the condition in MedlinePlus and then find listings of services near where the parent lives. A Missouri patient can learn more about a recent cancer diagnosis from MedlinePlus and then find local support groups or volunteer organizations willing to help. And, a Missouri parent finding day care services through Community Connection can learn more about childhood development and illnesses on MedlinePlus. These patients and families will all benefit from the Go Local links between MedlinePlus and Community Connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A special feature of Community Connection Go Local is the &amp;#34;Ask A Librarian&amp;#34; service from the J. Otto Lottes Health Science Library at the University of Missouri-Columbia. This link brings Missourians the services of expert information professionals in answering their questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Missouri Go Local Project is a partnership of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine-Midcontinental Region, Missouri Foundation for Health, and the University of Missouri-Columbia, including MU Extension, the Office of Social and Economic Data Analysis, the J.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;May 4, 2005: NLM expanded MedlinePlus Go Local coverage to include the states of Indiana and Massachusetts. Patients, families, and friends from those states join residents of North Carolina and Missouri in being able to link from MedlinePlus health information to local health services. For example, they can be looking at information on Diabetic Diet on MedlinePlus and link to local endocrinologists, dietitians, or diabetes clinics in their state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two states are the first areas to use the NLM&amp;#39;s new Go Local system. NLM now provides Go Local projects with a management system for all the descriptive information for the health services in their area. This system provides the links with MedlinePlus health information and frees the local Go Local project team from maintaining networked hardware or software. Each Go Local site uses their knowledge of local health services to promote Go Local to the citizens, health professionals and, and service providers in their area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INHealthConnect is a project of the &lt;a href="http://www.medlib.iupui.edu/"&gt;Indiana University School of Medicine Ruth Lilly Medical Library&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.incolsa.net/~ihsla/"&gt;Indiana Health Sciences Libraries Association&lt;/a&gt;. Go Local Massachusetts is sponsored by the &lt;a href="http://library.umassmed.edu/"&gt;Lamar Soutter Library&lt;/a&gt;, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 11, 2004: South Texas is now part of MedlinePlus Go Local. Residents of 38 counties in Southern Texas can find local health services via Lone Star Go Local, hosted by the &lt;a href="http://www.uthscsa.edu/"&gt;University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The path-breaking scientific discoveries and illustrious public career of Nobel Laureate Joshua Lederberg (b.1925) have been placed into historical context in a wide-ranging new exhibit text presented by the National Library of Medicine on its Profiles in Science Web site. At the same time, the extensive Lederberg archive on Profiles has been further enriched with the release over 300 additional digitized documents selected from the Lederberg papers at the National Library of Medicine, and a digital finding aid to his papers has been made available to online users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest release of Lederberg documents on Profiles brings the complete online collection to over 11,000 items, including letters, diaries, laboratory notebooks, published articles, and photographs. The newly-added documents span the length of Lederberg&amp;#39;s life and the breadth of his activities, depicting his early years, laboratory research, academic career, and corporate consulting work. Among them the user will find Lederberg&amp;#39;s application, at age fifteen, for laboratory privileges at the American Institute Science Laboratory, electronic mail from the early years of the Internet in the 1970s, and correspondence from such eminent scientists as AndrÃ© Lwoff, Herman Muller, Max DelbrÃ¼ck, and Selman Waksman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entirely rewritten and much-enlarged historical introduction to the site assesses Lederberg&amp;#39;s place in the development of modern genetics and of U.S. science and defense policy. His pioneering research into the mechanisms of gene action in bacteria made him one of the founders of molecular biology in the 1940s and 1950s. A prodigy who received the Nobel Prize at age 33, he helped lay the groundwork for genetic engineering, modern biotechnology, and genetic approaches to medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joshua Lederberg was born in Montclair, New Jersey, on May 23, 1925, the son of an orthodox rabbi. He was educated at Stuyvesant High School and Columbia University in New York City. He received a PhD degree from Yale University in 1947 for his discovery that certain bacteria undergo a sexual stage, that they mate and exchange genes. As a result of his discovery, bacteria became one of the most important experimental organisms in genetics. As professor of genetics and, later, medical genetics at the University of Wisconsin from 1947 to 1959, Lederberg described a form of genetic recombination in bacteria mediated by a viral vector, a process he called transduction. In subsequent decades transduction became one of the foundations of recombinant DNA research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lederberg received a share of the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &amp;#34;for his discoveries concerning genetic recombination and the organization of the genetic material of bacteria.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1959 he was named chairman of the newly-established Department of Genetics at Stanford University School of Medicine, a position that enabled him to relate genetics to the larger realm of human health and biology. While at Stanford he turned into an early proponent of space biology, and was instrumental in introducing computers and artificial intelligence into laboratory research and biomedical communicant as a collaborator on DENDRAL, one of the first expert systems in science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an abiding faith in the ability of government to improve society, secure peace, and protect the environment with the advice of scientific experts, Lederberg has served for over forty years on advisory commissions on science and health policy, space exploration, national security, and arms control. He has worked to bridge the gap between scientists and the public, most prominently by writing a weekly editorial column on science and society for the Washington Post between 1966 and 1971.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1978 Lederberg returned to New York as President of Rockefeller University. He became University Professor Emeritus and Raymond and Beverly Sackler Foundation Scholar in 1990, when he resumed his research into the chemistry and evolution of DNA and into computer modeling of scientific reasoning. He continues to advise government and lecture widely about developments in science as they relate to public policy and public health, in particular about the threat of bioterrorism and of both new and reemerging infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, Lederberg&amp;#39;s extensive collection of papers at the National Library of Medicine, from which the documents featured on Profiles are drawn, can be conveniently navigated through an electronic finding aid. The detailed finding aid allows online users to survey the scope and content of the Lederberg papers, and to delve through the series arrangement down to the level of individual archival folders. Also for the first time, the complete Lederberg papers described in the finding aid are now open to researchers on-site in the History of Medicine Division reading room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever come across a beautiful old book locked away in a glass case in a library and wanted to leaf through it? Now, you can (virtually), anywhere in the world, using a computer and Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the new, free, online version of &amp;#34;Turning the Pages&amp;#34; (&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/turningthepages"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/turningthepages&lt;/a&gt;) , viewers can flip through three treasured 16th century books from the National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s collection with a click of their computer mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, NLM is taking a page (pun intended) from its successful program that allows viewers to turn the pages of rare books virtually, via a touchscreen monitor, at kiosks at its Bethesda headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high-tech and historical worlds intersect in the &amp;#34;Turning the Pages&amp;#34; technology, which was pioneered by the British Library in 1998, came to NLM in 2001 and was subsequently re-engineered. In addition to looking at the high-quality digital images, the reader can use the zoom feature to magnify any portion of the page for more detail. An audioclip provides information about each page and that narrative, by NLM historians, can also be viewed as text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three works are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Konrad Gesner&amp;#39;s (1516-1565) Historiae Animalium (Studies on Animals) is a delightful compendium of colorful zoological hand- colored woodcuts. Although it includes descriptions of such creatures as satyrs and unicorns, this masterpiece was the first attempt to describe many of the world&amp;#39;s animals accurately.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ambroise Pare&amp;#39; (1510-1590), the author of the second book, Oeuvres (Collected Works), was a French surgeon from humble beginnings who revolutionized how surgeons treat wounds. His book features surgical instruments and prosthetic devices from the 16th century.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Andreas Vesalius&amp;#39;s (1514-1564), De Humani Corporis Fabrica (On the Fabric of the Human Body) features beautifully detailed engravings by artists from the workshop of Titian. Vesalius created the modern science of anatomy and produced one of the most influential works in the history of medicine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;We plan to continue adding to the online bookshelf of `Turning the Pages,&amp;#39;&amp;#34; said TTP project director Dr. George Thoma. &amp;#34;For historians, students and just about anyone, this program is a hit. It makes learning fun and it gives us a chance to show NLM volumes to people who might never have a chance to visit us.&amp;#34; Thoma is chief of the Communications Engineering Branch of NLM&amp;#39;s Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE: There are technical requirements for viewers wanting to view &amp;#34;Turning the Pages&amp;#34; online.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;CPU: At least 800 MHz CPU; 1.2+ GHz recommended&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RAM: 256 MB RAM required&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Connection: DSL, cable or T1 required&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Resolution: 1024 x 768 recommended&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Audio: A sound card and speakers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Web Browser: Internet Explorer 5+ recommended&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flash Player: Flash Player 6+ required.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When:&lt;/strong&gt; 6:00-7:30 PM, Thursday, June 30th, 2005&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where:&lt;/strong&gt; Lister Hill Auditorium, Lister Hill Center, Building 38A on the campus of the National Institutes of Health&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Admission:&lt;/strong&gt; Admission is free and seating is on a firstÂ­come-first-served basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine presents Hollywood and Women Doctors by Dr. Peter Dans, a special public program developed in conjunction with the Library&amp;#39;s current exhibition, &amp;#34;Changing the Face of Medicine: Celebrating America&amp;#39;s Women Physicians.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge to negative attitudes and assumptions presented by women in medicine has been played out on film in the twentieth century, as Hollywood struggled to represent women physicians in the movies. For the most part, women were simply excluded, with medicine represented as a man&amp;#39;s profession. In fact, the few portrayals of women doctors that do exist have almost invariably involved overcoming, with varying degrees of success, negative attitudes towards women physicians. As Hollywood catches up to the reality of women with successful careers in every area of the profession, this is beginning to change. Dr. Peter Dans will present a kaleidoscopic tour of Hollywood&amp;#39;s portrayals of women doctors, using film clips beginning with 1933&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;Mary Stevens M.D.&amp;#34; through 2002&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;Blood Work,&amp;#34; with time after the talk to answer your questions. All are welcome to attend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About the speaker: Peter Dans is an internist with special interests in infectious diseases, geriatrics, quality assurance, and ethics. He is an independent consultant on issues related to geriatric polypharmacy and drug safety in the elderly. He is the author or co-author of more than 100 scientific articles, book chapters, and other contributions to the medical literature. Since 1990, he has written movie reviews as &amp;#34;The Physician at the Movies&amp;#34; for Pharos, the quarterly publication of the Alpha Omega Alpha honor medical society. In 2000, his book Doctors in the Movies: Boil the Water and Just Say Aah! about how doctors have been portrayed in movies from the 30&amp;#39;s through the 90&amp;#39;s was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine is on the campus of the National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland. NIH is served by the Medical Center Station on Metro&amp;#39;s Red Line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are driving, enter the NIH campus at South Drive off Rockville Pike. Free parking is available after 5 PM at employee lots in front of and next to Lister Hill Center (NIH building 38A).

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is pleased to announce that it has renewed its funding for an additional three years (2005-8) for the leadership program jointly sponsored by NLM and the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries (AAHSL), offered in cooperation with the Association of Research Libraries&amp;#39; Office of Leadership and Management Services (ARL/ OLMS). The NLM/ AAHSL Leadership Fellows Program is focused on preparing emerging leaders for director positions in academic health center libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM Director Donald A.B. Lindberg said, &amp;#34;We are impressed with the early successes of this leadership development program in preparing promising library managers for directorship positions. It has been a highly effective collaboration with AAHSL and ARL, and we look forward to continued participation in the program.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AAHSL president J. Michael Homan said, &amp;#34;The demographics of the current leadership of the nation&amp;#39;s academic health sciences libraries are well known. Many will be retiring as the `baby boom generation&amp;#39; segues into its next life cycle in the coming 5-10 years. The highly successful NLM/ AAHSL Leadership Fellows Program has become of strategic importance in preparing the next generation of directors capable of meeting the many challenges and opportunities that will exist for our profession-through an exciting program of education, mentoring, and career guidance.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program, inaugurated in 2002, provides fellows with the opportunity to develop their knowledge and skills in a variety of learning settings, including exposure to leadership in another environment. They are paired with mentors who are academic health center library directors and participate in a year-long program that combines in-person leadership institutes with the cohort of other fellows and mentors, site visits, and an online learning community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen fellows have participated in the first three years of the program, and several have already assumed positions of greater responsibility. Applications from potential fellows and mentors for the fourth class are currently being accepted for the August 19, 2005, deadline. Information is available at &lt;a href="http://www.arl.org/olms/fellows/"&gt;http://www.arl.org/olms/fellows/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis affects nearly 44 million Americans or 55 percent of people 50 years of age or older. Ten million Americans are estimated to have this condition with another 34 million estimated to have low bone mass. According to the Surgeon General, Americans need to take care of their bone health NOW, or by 2020 half of all Americans will be at risk of fracture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to these statistics, the United States Bone and Joint Decade (USBJD), a multi-disciplinary initiative targeting the care of people with musculoskeletal conditions, has teamed up with the Public Library Association, the National Network of Libraries of Medicine, and the National Library of Medicine to launch &amp;#34;Fit to a T @ your library&amp;#34;--a new educational program focusing on bone health and osteoporosis prevention for men and women in their mid-40s and older. This is the first time that the USBJD, Public Library Association, the National Network of Libraries of Medicine and the National Library of Medicine are collaborating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fit to a T is being introduced in select cities and communities throughout the country, including San Antonio, Seattle, Newbury Park (CA), San Diego, Anaheim, Kansas City, Charlevoix (Michigan) and Flint. These events--a series of free, one-hour presentations--will take place during the 2005 United States Bone and Joint Decade National Awareness Week (October 12-20) and afterwards during the next several months, in local libraries. Noted health care experts, osteoporosis patients and library representatives will be on hand to give important information and answer questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fit to a T is one of many programs being offered during the United States Bone and Joint Decade (2002-2011). The Decade focuses on improving the quality of life, as well as advancing the understanding and treatment of those conditions through research, prevention and education. For more information about when and where these events will take place, visit &lt;a href="http://www.usbjd.org/"&gt;www.usbjd.org&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.fit2t.org/"&gt;www.fit2t.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald A.B. Lindberg, M.D., Director of the National Library of Medicine, believes that by working together, the organizations will raise much-needed public awareness of arthritis, back pain, osteoporosis, trauma and childhood conditions and their treatment. &amp;#34;We have to reach Americans in every part of our society--at work, home and play,&amp;#34; he says. &amp;#34;Libraries are in every community and they can play a vital role in providing our citizens with health information they can apply in their daily lives.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The program is called Fit to a T because the T-score is the measure of a person&amp;#39;s bone density and susceptibility for fracture,&amp;#34; says Nancy E. Lane, MD, president of the U.S. Bone and Joint Decade. &amp;#34;Attendees will be given an overview on osteoporosis prevention; the importance of self-assessment (or bone density) tests; relevant risk factors; preventive measures; and recommended lifestyle modifications.&amp;#34; Attendees to the Fit to T events will also be introduced to NLM&amp;#39;s MedlinePlus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;NLM Funds 18 AIDS Community Information Outreach Projects in September 2005 in the 12th Round of the Program&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM has continued its HIV/AIDS- related outreach efforts to community-based organizations, patient advocacy groups, faith-based organizations, departments of health, and libraries. This program provides support to design local programs for improving information access for AIDS patients and the affected community as well as their caregivers. Emphasis is on providing information or access in a way meaningful to the target community. Projects must involve one or more of the following information access categories: information retrieval, skills development, Internet access, resource development, and document access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awards were made for the following projects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Standard Award Projects&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;AIDS Education Global Information System (AEGIS) Ã¢ÂÂAIDS Community Outreach 2005Ã¢ÂÂ (San Juan Capistrano, CA)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;AEGiS seeks funding from NLM to assist in providing HIV/AIDS information to patients, the affected community, researchers and caregivers. AEGiS will accomplish this goal by maintaining content development assistance in support of Sr. Mary Elizabeth, the Operations Director of the AEGiS website. Funding will assist AEGiS in the linking of research documentation to NLMÃ¢ÂÂS PubMed abstract database and developing a conference abstract database. AEGiS is presently serving over 900,000 users per month, and has archived over 1.1 million documents dealing with HIV/AIDS. The sources for this information include, but are not limited to, the National Library of Medicine, AIDS Service Organization publications, and Wire services (Agence Presse France, Associated Press, Inter Press Service, Reuters, BBC, Wall Street Journal, etc.) All of this data is archived and is keyword searchable. With these new features, many articlesÃ¢ÂÂ footnotes will be linked so that original material is located easily on PubMed, and pre-Internet/CD ROM era abstracts of conferences will be accessible from the AEGIS website. The AIDS Education Global Information System (AEGiS) on the web: &lt;a href="http://www.aegis.org"&gt;http://www.aegis.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;AIDS Services in Asian Communities (ASIAC) Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂAsian &amp;#38; Pacific Islander Consortium HIV Health InformationÃ¢ÂÂ (Philadelphia, PA)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ASIAC is a 501(c) 3 community-based organization dedicated to providing culturally sensitive and language appropriate HIV/AIDS related services to Asian and Pacific Islanders (A&amp;#38;PIs) and their partners, family members, friends, and service providers in the Philadelphia area. The partnership between ASIAC, Philip Jaisohn Memorial Foundation, and The Southeast Asian Mutual Assistance Associations Coalition forms the Asian and Pacific Islander Consortium (APIC). Through the APIC HIV Health Information project, APIC will design, develop, produce, and distribute HIV/AIDS information brochures alerting A&amp;#38;PIs of HIV/AIDS resources available in their community. The brochures will be available in 5 Asian languages (Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Khmer, and Indonesian) to ensure cultural and linguistic appropriateness, and will address the following HIV/AIDS topics: HIV testing, living with HIV, Women &amp;#38; HIV, and HIV &amp;#38; Youth. The HIV/AIDS information brochures will be distributed to clients through the APIC consortium as well as by other community-based organizations, AIDS service organizations, clinics, and hospitals that work with A&amp;#38;PIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Bailey House, Inc. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂTechnical Assistance ClearinghouseÃ¢ÂÂ (New York, NY)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bailey House, Inc. was founded in 1983 in Greenwhich Village, New York, and is committed to empowering people living with HIV/AIDS, their loved ones, and the communities and agencies that serve them to achieve their fullest potential through the development and provision of housing, supportive services, and technical assistance. The goal of the Technical Assistance Clearinghouse project is to increase the awareness and access to HIV/AIDS information through the enhancement and expansion of the Technical Assistance Clearinghouse website. The project will be executed regionally within the states of New York and New Jersey and will consist of 3 major components: 1) The addition of HIV/AIDS related health care resources on the existing TA Clearinghouse website, 2) The expansion of the range of resources and marketing efforts for the New York and New Jersey regions, and 3) The development and distribution of a user-friendly guide to health care information via the Internet in three languages and in large type for the visually impaired. The Bailey House, Inc. on the web: &lt;a href="http://www.baileyhouse.org"&gt;http://www.baileyhouse.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Brooklyn Public Library Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂKnow Your ABCÃ¢ÂÂs to Prevent HIV ProjectÃ¢ÂÂ (Brooklyn, NY)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Know Your ABCÃ¢ÂÂs to Prevent HIV Project is a health information and educational campaign of the Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) in collaboration with the Caribbean WomenÃ¢ÂÂs Health Association, Wyckoff Heights Medical Center and the Church Avenue Merchants Block Association, Inc. (CAMBA). The project will host workshops and train librarians, community workers from partnering organizations, and other interested community organizations on how to access HIV/AIDS materials and online resources in English, Spanish, and Creole and how to conduct library-based educational programs on HIV/AIDS for adults and teens. In support of the educational and training workshops, BPL will develop an HIV/AIDS collection in English, Spanish, and Creole to be offered in various formats (print, video, DVD, and CD ROM). A bibliography of the collection will be prepared and disseminated in all 3 languages, and identified resources will be featured on the LibraryÃ¢ÂÂs website. The Brooklyn Public Library on the web: &lt;a href="http://www.brooklynpubliclibrary.org"&gt;http://www.brooklynpubliclibrary.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Camino de Vida Center for HIV Services Ã¢ÂÂ &amp;#34;Southwestern New Mexico HIV/AIDS Resource Development ProjectÃ¢ÂÂ (Las Cruces, NM)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Camino de Vida Center for HIV Services, a non-profit community-based organization, will provide access to printed and electronic information to those living with HIV/AIDS, those affected by HIV/AIDS, their care providers, and the general community. Funding through the NLM will provide the opportunity for the Camino de Vida Center for HIV Services to introduce a centralized HIV/AIDS Information Center within the agency. The Southwestern New Mexico HIV/AIDS Resource Development Project will increase accessibility to HIV/AIDS resources via the Internet, improve user and staff skills in locating HIV/AIDS resources through training, develop catalogs to assist users in locating resources, develop Spanish resources, and increase accessibility to HIV/AIDS related printed materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Center for AIDS Information &amp;#38; Advocacy Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂProject AIR 2005Ã¢ÂÂ (Houston, TX)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Center for AIDS (CFA) is a nonprofit, community-based organization that provides treatment and research information to people with HIV/AIDS and their caregivers. Since 2001, the CFA has successfully implemented and evaluated Project AIR (AIDS Information Roadshow), an innovative outreach program that has taught HIV-positive individuals, as well as caregivers and service providers, fundamental information about HIV/AIDS disease and treatment. The program provides Internet based training and curricula on how to obtain objective and accurate information about HIV/AIDS research and treatment options. The Project AIR has been successful in reaching minority participants and has been translated and presented in Spanish to better reach monolingual, Spanish-speaking people affected by HIV/AIDS. Through Project AIR 2005 sessions, persons living with HIV/AIDS and their providers/caregivers will be given a blueprint for building their own information Ã¢ÂÂsupport networksÃ¢ÂÂ both virtually (via the Internet) and physically in their community.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;br /&gt;8600 Rockville Pike&lt;br /&gt;Bethesda, Md. 20894&lt;br /&gt;History of Medicine Division&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through April 28, 2006&lt;br /&gt;Open Monday - Friday, 8:30 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The History of Medicine Division of the National Library of Medicine invites you to a new mini-exhibition focusing on the history of horse veterinary medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The horse has been one of the most important animals throughout human history, and healing horses has had an important place in veterinary and medical literature. Medieval and Renaissance theories about equine physiology and health often mirrored theories about humans, and the literature of both was inherently linked. Bloodletting, astrology, and ancient texts were used by both physicians and veterinarians to heal their patients, and many discoveries, including the circulation of the blood, developed in tandem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibition includes a small display of illustrated rare books from the Library&amp;#39;s collections dating from 1500 to 1704 featuring images from early veterinary horse medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For further information or images, please contact the curator of the show, Michael North, Head of Rare Books &amp;#38; Early Manuscripts, History of Medicine Division, National Library of Medicine, &lt;a href="mailto:northm@mail.nih.gov"&gt;northm@mail.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;; 301-496-9204; or visit the &lt;a href="/hmd/index.html"&gt;HMD Web site&lt;/a&gt;: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;LactMed, a free online database with information on drugs and lactation, is one of the newest additions to the National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s TOXNET system, a Web-based collection of resources covering toxicology, chemical safety, and environmental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LactMed may be searched at &lt;a href="http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/htmlgen?LACT"&gt;http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/htmlgen?LACT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geared to the healthcare practitioner and nursing mother, LactMed contains over 450 drug records. It includes information such as maternal levels in breast milk, infant levels in blood, potential effects in breastfeeding infants and on lactation itself, the American Academy of Pediatrics category indicating the level of compatibility of the drug with breastfeeding, and alternate drugs to consider. References are included, as is nomenclature information, such as the drug&amp;#39;s Chemical Abstract Service&amp;#39;s (CAS) Registry number and its broad drug class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LactMed was developed by a pharmacist who is an expert in this subject. Three other recognized authorities serve as the database&amp;#39;s scientific review panel. Ancillary resources, such as a glossary of terms related to drugs and lactation, and breastfeeding links are also offered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LactMed can be searched together with TOXNET&amp;#39;s other databases in a multi-database environment, to obtain other relevant information about drugs. As a work in progress, LactMed will continue to expand with additional drugs and be enhanced with other substances, such as industrial chemicals and radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Earth Day celebrates its 36th anniversary Saturday, April 22nd, and just in time for that occasion, the National Library of Medicine has spruced up its interactive mapping site, TOXMAP (&lt;a href="http://toxmap.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://toxmap.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;). In response to feedback from users, this popular, free resource will now provide more in-depth information about chemicals that are released into the environment and their possible effects on residents&amp;#39; health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOXMAP helps users explore the geographic distribution of certain chemical releases, their relative amounts, and their trends over time. By typing in a city and state, or a zip code, the user can instantly find out what substances are being released into water, earth, and air. This release data comes from industrial facilities around the United States, as reported annually to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, users can also use TOXMAP to find information about Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund sites. The Superfund program is part of a federal effort to clean up land in the United States that has been contaminated by hazardous waste and identified by the EPA (http://www.epa.gov/) as a candidate for cleanup because it poses a risk to human health and/or to the environment. The program was created in 1980 when Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The substances found at Superfund sites have been designated as causing or contributing to an increase in mortality or in irreversible or incapacitating illness, or posing a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or to the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, disposed of, or otherwise managed. More than 800 substances are currently designated as hazardous under the Superfund Program, and many more as potentially hazardous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the new version, TOXMAP has also added mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute&amp;#39;s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOXMAP continues to provide links to NLM&amp;#39;s extensive collection of toxicology and environmental health references, as well as to a rich resource of data on hazardous chemical substances in its TOXNET databases (&lt;a href="http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt;). The resource also provides fact sheets and summaries about the various chemicals, written by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, and EPA progress reports on the Superfund sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A complete guide to NLM&amp;#39;s environmental health resources, including the Household Products Database and Tox Town, can be found at &lt;a href="http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro.html"&gt;http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro.html&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Celebrating Ten Outstanding Health Information Programs at Libraries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the best library programs in the country addressing health and wellness issues? From a group of 50 state winners, ten outstanding health information projects have been chosen by a Federal panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 3rd, at a forum at the National Library of Medicine (NLM), representatives of the finalist libraries will recount their experiences in a day-long forum attended by consumer health information specialists and other information professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Health Information Awards program is sponsored by the U.S. National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS), an independent agency of the Federal government created to advise the President and Congress on national and international library and information policies and to develop plans for meeting national library and information needs. This is the second year of the nationwide competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The all-day forum featuring the ten finalist libraries will take place in the National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s Lister Hill Auditorium, Building 38A, on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland, Wednesday, May 3rd. Dr. J. Edward Hill, President of the American Medical Association will deliver the keynote address, and former NLM Board of Regents Chair Eugenie Prime, who served as manager of corporate libraries for Hewlett-Packard, will serve as the forum moderator. The ten finalists will discuss their programs in the day-long forum divided into three categories: &amp;#34;Effective Programs,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Health Literacy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Partnerships and Outreach.&amp;#34; Each finalist will be awarded a $1,000 prize in recognition of their library&amp;#39;s work. At a reception at the end of the day, the Commission will announce the Grand Prize Winner, with a prize of $20,000 to be awarded to that program.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ten finalists selected by a panel of NCLIS Commissioners are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;California:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pacific College of Oriental Medicine Library.

It integrates principles of Eastern and Western medical traditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecticut:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healthnet. For more than two decades, the Connecticut Consumer Health Network, an outreach program of the library at the University of Connecticut Health Center, has enabled citizens to access high quality, authoritative consumer health information directly through their local public libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idaho:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GetReal, Get Fit! With state statistics showing that one of every five Idahoans is obese, the Portneuf District Library in Chubbock is targeting its multigenerational, multi-ethic patrons for quality fitness programs for adolescents and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kentucky:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olive Hill Adult Learning Center/Library. Located in a very rural area of the state-the county is the only one in Kentucky without a tax-supported library -this library is totally staffed by volunteers. It works to support the education of teens in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massachusetts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Access to Community Health Resources (ARCH). Treadwell Library, Massachusetts General Hospital, created this new model for health information delivery to four poor, urban and underserved communities. The goal is to provide access, especially electronic access, to quality health information, to help people who live and work in these communities to make more informed decisions regarding their health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minnesota:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minnesota Prevention Resource Center (MPRC). Making resources about alcohol, tobacco and drug use programs available throughout the state, MPRC has provided information, training and technical assistance through its library and clearinghouse since 1981. Prevention is a key component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mississippi:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consumer Health Education Center (CHEC). A program of the Rowland Medical Library, University of Mississippi Medical Center, CHEC seeks to reduce the effects of inadequate health information associated with health disparities and to improve knowledge of health issues associated with health literacy among all members of the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Carolina:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REACH 2010. The Charleston and Georgetown Diabetes Coalition&amp;#39;s Library Partnership expands Internet access at five community sites and trains people to use high quality diabetes information through libraries and the Internet. Reach 2010 seeks to eliminate disparities for more than 12,000 African Americans diagnosed with diabetes by improving self-management and care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tennessee:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Health Information Center (HIC). Recognizing Memphis as &amp;#34;an unhealthy city,&amp;#34; the Memphis Public Library&amp;#39;s Health Information Center serves as the central resource for health information. HIC is now identified as the recognized community asset for empowering Memphis citizens to improve their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virginia:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Community Outreach Information Network (COIN). Sponsored by the Tompkins-McCaw Library of Virginia Commonwealth University Libraries, COIN offers four consumer health information centers to the general public.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine is pleased to announce the 2006-2007 year of the leadership program jointly sponsored with the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries (AAHSL). The NLM/AAHSL Leadership Fellows Program is focused on preparing emerging leaders for director positions in academic health center libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;This collaboration of NLM and AAHSL is of exceptional value for the next generation of directors and to the profession as a whole. It is a model that other associations are looking to,&amp;#34; said AAHSL president Logan Ludwig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellows will have the opportunity to develop their knowledge and skills in a variety of learning settings, including exposure to leadership in another environment. They will be paired with mentors who are academic health center library directors. In addition to the individual relationship with their mentors, fellows benefit from working collaboratively with other fellows and mentors. Experienced program faculty and mentors will provide content and facilitation for the cohort. The program takes advantage of flexible scheduling and an online learning community to minimize disruption to professional and personal schedules. The sponsors will provide financial support for up to five fellows and will underwrite travel and meeting expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty fellows and mentors have participated in the program since its inauguration in 2002. To date, six of the fifteen fellows from the first three classes have received promotions to positions of higher responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;I can&amp;#39;t stress enough the value of the program as a key factor in my being appointed to a director position,&amp;#34; noted Judy Consales, fellow, class of 2002-2003. &amp;#34;It strengthened my professional skills and enhanced my vision, and my administration recognized the merit of the NLM/AAHSL connection.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karen Brewer, mentor, class of 2005-2006, said, &amp;#34;We don&amp;#39;t often get the chance to reflect and discuss `directorship&amp;#39; in this way. I&amp;#39;ve learned as much from my fellow as she has from me.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jo Dorsch, fellow, class of 2003-2004, stated, &amp;#34;The fellowship created an instant nationwide network fueled by the shared experience. The relationships I developed with my mentor and the fellows continue to evolve and are a valued source of advice, support, and friendship.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Program Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one-year program design is multi-faceted: three in-person leadership institutes; attendance at an Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) annual meeting; a yearlong fellow/mentor relationship; Web-based activities and discussion on issues related to library leadership; and a two-week site visit to the mentor&amp;#39;s home library (in one or two-week segments).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program is designed to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduce fellows to leadership theory and practical tools for implementing change at organizational and professional levels;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduce fellows to critical issues facing academic health center libraries;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop meaningful professional relationships between fellows and mentors that give fellows access to career guidance and support;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expose fellows to another academic health center library and its institutional leadership under the guidance of their mentors;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examine career development and provide models of directors to potential future academic health center library directors;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a cohort of learners who will draw upon each other for support throughout their careers;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Promote diversity in the leadership of the profession; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Offer recognition to emerging leaders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM/AAHSL Leadership Fellows Program is currently accepting applications and nominations for the August 18, 2006, deadline for potential fellows and mentors for the 2006-2007 experience.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine is pleased to announce that its Profiles in Science Web site has been further enriched by an extensive selection from the papers of one of the fathers of modern immunology, Michael Heidelberger. With this addition the number of prominent researchers and public health officials whose personal and professional records are presented on Profiles has grown to nineteen. The site is at &lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;profiles.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Heidelberger (1888--1991) was the founder of immunochemistry, the branch of biochemistry that examines the immune system of animals on a molecular level. His seminal discovery with Oswald T. Avery (also on Profiles in Science) in 1923 that powerful disease-causing antigens of pneumococcus bacteria are polysaccharides opened up an expansive new area in the study of microorganisms, and brought about a new understanding of infectious diseases, their treatment, and their prevention. &amp;#34;Heidelberger redefined the field of immunology and founded it on the precise analytical basis of biochemistry,&amp;#34; says Donald A.B. Lindberg, M.D., Director of the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his long scientific career--he lived to be 103--Heidelberger devoted himself single-mindedly to exploring the role of polysaccharides in immune phenomena. Using polysaccharide antigens as reagents, he determined, for the first time, the exact weight and many structural details of antigens and the antibodies that fight them. During the 1930s he showed that antibodies are proteins, until then a matter of scientific dispute, and that antibodies and antigens are multivalent, meaning that they have two or (in the case of antigens) more binding sites. He drew on these findings to develop a vaccine against pneumonia whose effectiveness was first proven in World War II soldiers, and which in modified form remains in use today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Heidelberger was born in 1888 in New York City, and decided at age eight that he wanted to be a chemist, which he himself later judged no more than a &amp;#34;pigheaded idea.&amp;#34; He received all of his academic degrees from Columbia University, culminating with a Ph.D. in organic chemistry in 1911. During his years of schooling he also developed his second passion, classical music. He became a clarinetist of professional caliber, and took his instrument with him wherever he went to join in chamber music performances at conferences or the homes of friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a year in the laboratory of the 1915 Nobel Laureate Richard WillstÃ¤tter in ZÃ¼rich, Heidelberger joined the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research (today Rockefeller University), where he developed important chemotherapeutic drugs, including tryparsamide, an effective agent against African sleeping sickness. In 1923, Heidelberger and his Rockefeller Institute colleague Oswald Avery reported that the substance which determined the virulence of different types of pneumococcus bacteria consisted not of proteins, as most scientists had expected, but of polysaccharides, a form of carbohydrates. Their discovery established a relationship between the chemical constitution of antigens and their mode of action in the body, long a goal of immunologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After fifteen years at the Rockefeller Institute and one year at Mount Sinai Hospital, Heidelberger took a position as consulting research chemist in the Department of Medicine of the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. There he and his collaborators Forrest E. Kendall and Elvin A. Kabat formulated a quantitative theory of immune reactions, which allowed for the accurate measurement of the antibody content of vaccines made from antisera. They also were the first to isolate certain proteins, which are called complement, that regulate antibody-antigen reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1954, Heidelberger moved to the Institute of Microbiology at Rutgers University, before becoming adjunct professor in the Department of Pathology at New York University Medical School in 1963. He published over 350 scientific articles, spread over every decade of the twentieth century. His discoveries were honored in 1953 and again in 1978 with a Lasker Award, often called America&amp;#39;s Nobel Prize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online exhibition features correspondence, diary entries, draft and published articles, laboratory notebooks, and photographs from the Michael Heidelberger collection at the National Library of Medicine. Visitors to the site can view, for example, a diary of Heidelberger&amp;#39;s grand tour of leading European research laboratories in 1924, the score for a march Heidelberger composed on the occasion of his wedding in 1916, and his humorous explanation of &amp;#34;My Idea of Why I Failed to Win a Nobel Prize.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profiles in Science was launched September 1998 by the National Library of Medicine, a part of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, a constituent agency of the Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

With lively animations, surprising sound effects and lots of positive reinforcement, ToxMystery provides a fun, game-like experience, while teaching important lessons about potential environmental health hazards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children visiting ToxMystery have an able guide in &amp;#34;Toxie&amp;#34; the cat, who helps find the hazards hidden in each room and offers hints when needed. The objective is to find all the hazards-- in the living room, bathroom, garage and other areas. Ever seen a cat...dance? Players will be treated to that spectacle and more when they identify all the hazards in a room. When all the risky spots in the house have been discovered, Toxie delivers an animated celebration, and players can print a personalized certificate of completion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ToxMystery&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;Parent Resources&amp;#34; page provides more detailed information about everyday environmental hazards that can be harmful to one&amp;#39;s health. A &amp;#34;For Teachers&amp;#34; page contains more than ten downloadable activity pages that can be used in elementary school classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ToxMystery has been enthusiastically tested by real kids, who enjoyed &amp;#34;answering the questions and playing the game,&amp;#34; hearing Toxie talk &amp;#34;about all the hazards,&amp;#34; watching items in the rooms &amp;#34;hover around and make sounds&amp;#34; and seeing &amp;#34;Toxie do funny things when you finish a room.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ToxMystery joins a number of other new NLM resources (at &lt;a href="http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro.html"&gt;http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro.html&lt;/a&gt;) geared toward the general public. It was created by NLM&amp;#39;s Specialized Information Services Division, which is responsible for information resources and services in toxicology, environmental health, chemistry, HIV/AIDS, and specialized topics in minority health. SIS (at &lt;a href="http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt;) celebrates its 40th anniversary this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

The following milestones may help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Richard Nixon is President -- and the Watergate break-in won&amp;#39;t take place until the following summer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#34;All in the Family&amp;#34; debuts on CBS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 26th Amendment lowers the voting age from 21 to 18&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The National Library of Medicine launches MEDLINEÂ®, or MEDLARSÂ® Online, October 27th&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;How far we have come since then!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some comparisons between the MEDLINE of 1971 and the MEDLINE of today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 1971, according to the September-October &lt;em&gt;National Library of Medicine NEWS&lt;/em&gt; of that year, MEDLINE featured 239 indexed journals. In 2006, that number has grown to 4,928.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 1971, MEDLINE served 25 users. (As that same issue of the &lt;em&gt;NLM NEWS&lt;/em&gt; reported, &amp;#34;By January 1972, it is planned that the network will be extended so that the computer can be reached by a local call in at least twenty major cities.&amp;#34;) In 2006, MEDLINE/PubMed will average 77 million unique visits in 2006 and about 800 million searches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 1971, MEDLINE was available via dial-up telecommunications. &amp;#34;Each user of the service will pay for his own terminal and telephone costs.&amp;#34; In 2006, the site is available to anyone on earth via the World Wide Web.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 1971, MEDLINE operated on an IBM 360/50 mainframe computer. In 2006, MEDLINE/PubMed runs on 20 Dell PowerEdge 1850 Servers, 2 CPU 8Gb RAM, with the Linux operating system in 64-bit mode. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;View photographs of NLM&amp;#39;s various computers from the 1960s to the present at &lt;a href="history_nlm_computerroom.pdf"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/history_nlm_computerroom.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (PDF, 5.6MB)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a more detailed MEDLINE time capsule and links to more information about MEDLINE and PubMedÂ®, go to the NLM Technical Bulletin at: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/so06/so06_med_35.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/so06/so06_med_35.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;View a PDF version (450KB) of the complete article, &amp;#34;NLM to Introduce MEDLINE Service,&amp;#34; from the September-October 1971 NLM NEWS at &lt;a href="medline_news_article.pdf"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/medline_news_article.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE EVOLUTION OF MEDLINE: ONE INTELLIGENT DESIGN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical practitioners and medical researchers both depend on the accumulated wisdom of those who have gone before. It was not so long ago that one could assemble this wisdom only by poring over printed bibliographies, usually the &lt;em&gt;Index Medicus&lt;/em&gt;, which the National Library of Medicine, under John Shaw Billings, began publishing in 1879. Today, virtually all biomedical scientists, many health practitioners, and an increasing number of consumers search MEDLINE/PubMedÂ® (more about PubMed, below) to learn about published research findings. This is the story of how an NIH &amp;#34;discovery&amp;#34; has evolved over the decades to become a service that is not only indispensable to medical research and practice, but one that is consulted millions of times each year by the general public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pioneering MEDLINE project, begun by NLM in the early 1970s, evolved from the computerized system used to produce the &lt;em&gt;Index Medicus&lt;/em&gt;, which the NLM had installed in 1964. MEDLINE was the first successful marriage of a large reference database with a national telecommunications network, and it has been called the Model T of online databases: although it would usually get you where you wanted to go, it required a pioneering spirit to master its intricacies and the patience of Job to deal with its idiosyncrasies. Even so, the NLM received more requests than it could handle from medical librarians, who wanted to be trained so that they could conduct literature for health professionals and scientists in hospitals, universities, and laboratories. As noted above, the original system covered 239 journals, and NLM boasted that it was &amp;#34;capable of supporting up to 25 simultaneous users.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eighties saw the introduction of &amp;#34;Grateful Med,&amp;#34; a software program created by NLM that one could load onto a PC or Macintosh and, equipped with a modem and a password, search MEDLINE right from one&amp;#39;s home, office or laboratory. Grateful Med was eagerly snapped up not only by librarians but by health professionals, scientists, students, lawyers, medical journalists and others, who saw the average charge of $2 per MEDLINE search as a bargain. Trying to find the same information in the printed Index Medicus would surely cost much more, in time and effort, if it could be done at all. At the height of the Grateful Med era, the number of registered users reached 125,000 and coverage had increased to almost 4,000 journals. Another change by then was that most MEDLINE references were accompanied by an abstract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1990s, of course, was the era of the Internet and the World Wide Web. NLM had one of the earliest Federal Web sites (1993) and introduced MEDLINE searching via the &amp;#34;Internet Grateful Med&amp;#34; in 1996. Dr. Michael DeBakey, then a Regent of the Library, and Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, a surgeon, introduced the new system at a press conference. The following year, Vice President Gore introduced free MEDLINE searching via the Web, using a new system called PubMed. Now, for the first time, anyone with access to the Web could search through an immense database of references and abstracts to more millions of journal articles. A decade later, PubMed has evolved into an essential biomedical resource used throughout the world. Read more about PubMed&amp;#39;s tenth anniversary below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, PubMed and Internet Grateful Med had both simplified MEDLINE searching to the point where the public encountered no difficulty at all in retrieving relevant references on any biomedical subject from the literature. Since about 30 percent of all MEDLINE searches are being done by consumers, this presented the NLM with a wonderful opportunity. Why not create a service that not only will provide selective MEDLINE results that are useful to the consumer, but also link the Web user to the authoritative, full-text health information being put out by NIH institutes and by a variety of non-Federal sources&amp;#34; Such a service, called MedlinePlus, at &lt;a href="http://medlineplus.gov"&gt;http://medlineplus.gov&lt;/a&gt;, was introduced in October 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AND, IN RELATED NEWS, HAPPY 10TH BIRTHDAY, PUBMED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another major milestone, ten years ago, was the launch of PubMed. It was first released in January 1996 as an experimental database under the Entrez retrieval system, with full access to MEDLINE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;#34;experimental&amp;#34; was dropped from the Web site in April 1997, and on June 26, 1997, a Capitol Hill press conference officially announced free MEDLINE access via PubMed. PubMed searches were approximately two million for the month of June 1997, while current usage typically exceeds three million searches per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a more detailed look at PubMed&amp;#39;s history, please consult the &lt;em&gt;NLM Technical Bulletin&lt;/em&gt; at: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/so06/so06_pm_10.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/so06/so06_pm_10.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To read more about the Capitol Hill press conference announcing free MEDLINE searching via PubMed, go to: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/archive/20040423/pubs/nlmnews/maraug97.html#Gore"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/archive/20040423/pubs/nlmnews/maraug97.html#Gore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about the difference between MEDLINE and PubMed, please consult the fact sheet at: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/dif_med_pub.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/dif_med_pub.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2006: MORE MILESTONES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2006 marks the 170th anniversary of NLM, since its 1836 founding as the Library of the Office of the Surgeon General of the Army.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a detailed chronology of milestones at NLM since its creation as the library of Surgeon General of the Army in 1836, go to: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/nlmhistory.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/nlmhistory.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;October 1, 2006 was the 50th anniversary of the passage of the National Library of Medicine Act, which moved the Armed Forces Medical Library to the Public Health Service and rechristened it the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2006 marks the 40th birthday of NLM&amp;#39;s Specialized Information Services Division (SIS), at &lt;a href="http://sis.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;http://sis.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Memoriam: Stewart Wolf, M.D.: Pioneer of Psychosomatic Medicine and Former Regent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was with sadness that NLM learned of the death of former Board of Regents member (1965-69) and chair (1967-69) Stewart Wolf, M.D. He was 91. His tenure on the Board of Regents during the latter half of the 1960s coincided with a number of important events in the history of NLM, including the passage of the Medical Library Assistance Act, the introduction of MEDLARS computer searching, and the establishment of both the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications and the Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Stewart Wolf was really one of the pioneers of psychosomatic medicine,&amp;#34; noted Paul Rosch, president of the American Institute of Stress, in The Lancet. &amp;#34;His book on stress and hypertension is still considered a classic in the field... He was a marvelous cultured person who was able to bring a broad background in the humanities to his approach to patients and to teaching.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolf earned his medical degree in 1938 from the Johns Hopkins University and trained at Cornell-New York Hospital. During World War II, he ran a 1,000-bed hospital in the southwest Pacific. He returned to Cornell after the war and in 1952 was appointed chair of internal medicine at the University of Oklahoma. The following year, Dr. Wolf was hired as Supervisor of Clinical Research at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation and named head of the Department of Medicine at the University of Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1941-1957, Dr. Wolf studied digestive diseases with the help of a patient, Tom Little, who lived with a hole in his stomach, to compensate for a childhood accident. Wolf was interested in how the mind and body interacted and observed changes in the way Tom&amp;#39;s stomach looked with changes in emotion. For a more complete story of this patient, see Young, W. Landon, Oklahoma&amp;#39;s Hidden Treasure; a history of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, pp. 61-62. (This work is in the NLM collection.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 1960s, Dr. Wolf also began studying the people of Roseto, PA, after a physician from that town told him that he hardly ever saw patients with heart attacks who were younger than age 50. That was in stark contrast to neighboring towns, which made Wolf think that there might be something specific about the lifestyle of the town&amp;#39;s residents, most of whom were Italian immigrants, that had a beneficial effect on their health. (They were trusting, supportive of one another and seemed to enjoy life, he discovered.) Dr. Wolf was to study the community for decades, and found that over time the rate of myocardial infractions rose, which he attributed to its citizens embracing the prevailing American culture and lifestyle. Dr. Wolf described a &amp;#34;Sisyphus complex&amp;#34; that turned out to have strong parallels to type A personalities and heart disease, an idea which was beginning to be floated at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wolf retired from Oklahoma University in 1967, shifting to full-time employment at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation until 1978, when he moved to Pennsylvania, to be able to spend more time studying the people of Roseto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo: Dr. Stewart Wolf with his longtime patient, Tom Little,&lt;br /&gt;at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation in 1956.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Dr. Wolf at bedside with patient" border="1" height="234" src="/news/wolf.jpg" width="330" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;When a doctor sees a patient, he or she often prescribes medications. But what if a doctor also wants to direct a patient to current, reliable, consumer-friendly information about a genetic condition, or overviews about illness, health and disease prevention?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under a new pilot program, more than 12,000 members of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) from Pennsylvania, Michigan, Kentucky, and Florida are encouraged to refer their patients to MedlinePlus.gov, a free, trustworthy, patient-friendly Web site of the National Library of Medicine(NLM). MedlinePlus.gov is available on the Internet at: &lt;a href="http://www.medlineplus.gov/"&gt;www.medlineplus.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Part of a physician&amp;#39;s job is to explain illnesses, diagnoses and treatments to their patients,&amp;#34; says Donald A.B. Lindberg, MD, Director of the National Library of Medicine. &amp;#34;NLM&amp;#39;s MedlinePlus.gov provides authoritative, user-friendly, and commercial-free information that doctors can use to supplement information provided in the office or clinic. We think it saves time and improves doctors&amp;#39; communications with patients, in addition to its obvious value in helping keep the public healthy.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under this new pilot program, about one-third of AOA&amp;#39;s member physicians will be urged to &amp;#34;prescribe&amp;#34; information from MedlinePlus using a special &amp;#34;prescription pad&amp;#34; given to patients during office visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Physicians have always known that an informed patient who takes an active role is a &amp;#39;&amp;#39;better&amp;#39; patient,&amp;#34; notes John A. Strosnider, DO, President, American Osteopathic Association. &amp;#34;We believe that both patients and their doctors will welcome this additional tool-good medical information-in their continuing efforts to provide good health care, for patients and their families.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MedlinePlus.gov has information on more than 700 diseases and conditions, and links to pre-formulated searches of the MEDLINE database, which enables anyone to find references to the latest professional articles on health topics. Under each topic, patients will find information on symptoms, diagnosis and treatment, current news stories, research studies, clinical trials, helpful graphics, and interactive tutorials. Medline Plus accepts no advertising and most information in available in English and Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AOA and the NLM Information Rx Pilot program provides participating physicians with a poster, bookmarks, and a supply of prescription pads, which can be used to write in a disease or condition and advise patients how to look up information on MedlinePlus. The NLM&amp;#39;s National Network of Libraries of Medicine will help patients who have questions about access to MedlinePlus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar Information Rx Project, pointing patients to NLM&amp;#39;s MedlinePlus database, was launched in 2003 with the American College of Physicians. This earlier program was well received by participating physicians and their patients nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;An updated version of the Web-based browser RxNav is now available to search RxNorm, the NLM database of standard names for clinical drugs that references the names of approximately 17,000 clinical drugs from several sources. RxNav displays graphically links from clinical drugs, both branded and generic, to their active ingredients (e.g., Ibuprofen), drug components (e.g., Ibuprofen 200 MG) and drug forms (Ibuprofen Oral Tablet). It also associates generic with brand names (e.g., Ibuprofen / Advil).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every aspect of the RxNorm database can be queried through RxNav, including the names and codes of drugs and components in the drug resources referenced by RxNorm. Spelling suggestions are offered when no exact match is found in RxNorm for a given input term. RxNav accesses the RxNorm server at NLM, which is updated monthly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;We hope that our tool makes it easier for physicians and pharmacists to deal with electronic drug prescription and to integrate drug information from various sources,&amp;#34; says Dr. Olivier Bodenreider, one of the co-developers of the software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RxNav is available at: &lt;a href="http://mor.nlm.nih.gov/download/rxnav/"&gt;http://mor.nlm.nih.gov/download/rxnav/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;To celebrate African American History Month, 2007, the National Library of Medicine has 28 full-color panels for public viewing from the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. The panels are on display the month of February in the lobby of the Library&amp;#39;s Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications (Building 38A on the National Institutes of Health campus).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;African Americans, perhaps more than any other populations in the Americas, have been shaped by migration. Their culture and history are the products of black peoples&amp;#39; various movements, coerced and voluntary, that started in the Western Hemisphere 500 years ago. This full color, 28-panel exhibition and a companion Web site, &amp;#34;In Motion: The African American Migration Experience,&amp;#34; examine how African Americans, constantly in motion, have formed and transformed themselves and their landscape through migration. To view the Schomburg&amp;#39;s online version of the &amp;#34;In Motion&amp;#34; exhibit go here: &lt;a href="http://www.inmotionaame.org/"&gt;http://www.inmotionaame.org/&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="middle" alt="Exhibits Web Site" border="2" height="200" src="/news/in_motion.jpg" width="350" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The images presented on these panels have been selected from the archives of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. This is the seventh year that the National Library of Medicine has featured pictorial materials from the Schomburg collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visitors to the National Library of Medicine (on the campus of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland) are reminded that heightened security measures are in effect. Information about these is at &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/about/visitorsecurity.htm"&gt;http://www.nih.gov/about/visitorsecurity.htm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note to teachers and administrators:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To arrange for a tour of the exhibition, please call Mr. David Nash, National Library of Medicine, 301-496-1046.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;When was the first artificial heart implanted in a human? What does the space program have to do with artificial organs? Can an artificial gill allow humans to live like fish? A bear can live for long periods of time without kidneys. Can a human? What are the physical obstacles for using artificial organs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answers to these and other questions about organ and transplant research will be heard at an upcoming symposium, the Michael E. DeBakey Seminar in Medicine, Tuesday, March 6, 2007, at the New York University School of Medicine, 550 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016, from 9:30 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. This is the third in a series of seminars to be convened by NIH&amp;#39;s National Library of Medicine. Washington, DC and Chicago were hosts to previous seminars and a fourth will be held in Houston this fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Developments and advances are occurring at incredible speed--all directed toward improving human health and the quality of life,&amp;#34; noted Michael E. DeBakey, MD*, pioneering heart surgeon and Director, Baylor College of Medicine DeBakey Heart Center. He added, &amp;#34;I know that the presentations you hear today will kindle even greater interest, and I can ensure an exciting and fulfilling career to those who pursue this interest.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Seminar will bring together top scientists and medical doctors in the organ and transplant field to discuss and demonstrate the latest advances in research. About 500 high school science students, invited from New York Metropolitan area, will be able to ask questions of the speakers following their individual presentations and explore exhibits featuring artificial body parts and the latest examples of medical breakthroughs. They will be able to see and touch heart stents, pacemakers, oxygenators (old and new), a coronary artery bypass graft and photo of DeBakey performing surgery, hearing aids (old and new), and the original DeBakey intravenous roller pump (1935) which led to the concept of the first heart-lung machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Michael E. DeBakey, MD, who turned 98 years old this year, is an internationally recognized and respected physician and surgeon noted for his pioneering work in the field of cardiovascular surgery. Dacron pumps, arterial bypass operations, artificial hearts, heart pumps and heart transplants are common procedures in todays medicine, thanks to Dr. DeBakey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

As announced today by Mike Leavitt, Secretary of Health and Human Services, HHS is one of nine charter members of the IHTSDO. NLM represents HHS and the U.S. in the new organization and will continue to distribute SNOMED CT through its Unified Medical Language SystemÂ® (UMLSÂ®) MetathesaurusÂ®. NLM will also make SNOMED CT available in its native format as required by the IHTSDO. Uniform international license terms for SNOMED CTÂ® will replace the U.S.-wide license terms NLM negotiated with the CAP in 2003, giving U.S. users broader rights to distribute derivative products internationally. The new license terms have been incorporated into the License for Use of the UMLS Metathesaurus. Existing UMLS licensees MUST review and accept the revised UMLS license online by MAY 15, 2007 in order to retain uninterrupted access to the UMLS Knowledge Source Server and related resources. Obtaining a UMLS license provides access to the UMLS Metathesaurus and other vocabulary resources including SNOMED CT files in their native format (effective May 15, 2007), RxNorm files in their native format, mapping files, UMLS-enriched subsets of specific vocabularies, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UMLS License Agreement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://wwwcf.nlm.nih.gov/umlslicense/index.html"&gt;Establish a NEW license&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Marjorie Cahn, former head of NLM&amp;#39;s National Information Center on Health Services Research and Health Care Technology (NICHSR), received the Theodore R. Ervin Award from the Public Health Foundation (PHF) on April 24th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ervin Award recognizes her many contributions to the mission of PHF, including: 1) engaging PHF as a member of the Partners in Information Access for Public Health Professionals initiative; 2) helping to create the Healthy People 2010 Information Access Project; 3) spearheading recruitment and retention initiatives of the Council on Linkages Between Academia and Public Health Practice; and 4) ensuring the success of the Community Health Status Indicators project (online county health profiles due to be released in September 2007). Information about these initiatives appears on NICHSR&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;Health Services Research and Public Health Information Programs&amp;#34; page, at &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hsrph.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hsrph.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ervin Award was established by the PHF in 1993, in honor of Ted Ervin, who was a member of the PHF Board of Directors from 1982 to 1989 and served as the organization&amp;#39;s first chairman, from 1982 to 1984.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cahn joined the NLM staff in 1991 and retired in 2006. Among other honors in a distinguished career that included posts at the National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and the Urban Institute, she received the NIH Merit Award in 1997, for establishing and leading NICHSR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Marj Cahn Accepting Award" border="0" height="208" src="/news/marj_cahn.jpg" width="271" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marj Cahn receives the Theodore R.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;As the US Member of the &lt;a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org/"&gt;International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (IHTSDO), the National Library of Medicine is soliciting nominations for candidates for positions on four standing IHTSDO Committees - Content, Technology, Quality Assurance, and Research &amp;#38; Innovation - that will play an important role in ongoing development of the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/snomed_main.html"&gt;SNOMED CT&lt;/a&gt; clinical terminology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Committees are described in Sections 9.4-9.9 of the Articles of the IHTSDO (&lt;a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Docs_01/Articles_of_Association_for_IHTSDO.html#9"&gt; http://www.ihtsdo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Docs_01/Articles_of_Association_for_IHTSDO.html#9&lt;/a&gt;). There will be 12 people on each Committee, per decision of the IHTSDO Management Board. As an IHTSDO Member, NLM may nominate 2 people for each Committee. There are 9 current IHTSDO members so there will be a maximum of 18 nominees for each Committee. The IHTSDO General Assembly will elect 12 people from among those nominated for a particular Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Election to Committees will be one of several ways of participating in the ongoing development of SNOMED CT. Based on discussions in recent transition meetings, the IHTSDO Articles (specifically Sections 9.4.8-9.4.9) are being amended to allow open participation in Working Groups. There will also be an Affiliates Forum open to everyone with a SNOMED CT license. (Any current UMLS licensee will be eligible to participate.) In addition, specific experts may be asked to participate on Harmonization Bodies formed to define the relationship of SNOMED CT to other standards, on Ad Hoc committees, or special project teams. Details about these mechanisms will be forthcoming over the next 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transfer of ownership of SNOMED CT provides exciting new opportunities for effective international collaboration to improve and align the content of this important standard terminology with other key health information technology standards. The IHTSDO Committees will be important in taking advantage of these opportunities. NLM seeks nominations of strong candidates who represent a broad range of those with a stake in interoperability standards, e.g., health care delivery, public health, government, private industry. Submit nominations via email to &lt;a href="mailto:nichsr@nlm.nih.gov"&gt;nichsr@nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt; by midnight on Tuesday, June 12, 2007. Include a brief biosketch and a description of the specific qualifications of the nominee for one or more Committees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM will select two nominees for each Committee in consultation with the Chair, Healthcare Information Technology Standards Board, the Chair, National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, and the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Dr. John Phillip &amp;#34;Jack&amp;#34; McGovern, who served on the NLM Board of Regents from 1970 to 1974 and chaired it 1973-4, died May 31st of pneumonia in Galveston, Texas. He was 85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table align="left" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="80"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="John P. McGovern, MD" border="1" height="226" src="/news/mcgovern.jpg" width="150" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;His era on the Board was an exciting one at the National Library of Medicine. It saw the inauguration of MEDLINE, the beginning of a national toxicology online search service, a number of satellite-based communications experiments, and, just to show that nothing is new, emergency outreach to flood-ravaged medical libraries in Pennsylvania (Hurricane &amp;#34;Agnes&amp;#34;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internationally known as a distinguished American physician, philanthropist, humanitarian and scholar, McGovern made his name as a leader in treating allergies and asthma. His McGovern Allergy and Asthma Clinic, which he founded in Houston in 1956, was one of the nation&amp;#39;s first for diagnosing and treating disorders. While working at the clinic (he retired in 1986), Dr. McGovern kept up an active career of teaching, research and scholarship. In all, he held appointments to 17 professorships at 15 universities such as George Washington, Tulane, and Baylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of a surgeon, McGovern graduated from Duke University School of Medicine in 1945. He was trained as a pediatrician and, during medical school, developed an interest in medical research that continued to his death. His medical interests expanded to treating allergies, and he opened a small allergy clinic for children at a New Orleans hospital. That planted the seed for the creation of his own clinic, in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. McGovern received honorary degrees from 28 major colleges and universities. He was awarded the Distinguished Alumnus Award from Duke in 1976.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. McGovern received the Private Sector Initiative commendation in 1985 from President Ronald Reagan for his &amp;#34;lifetime of meritorious service in medicine and generous contributions to his community&amp;#34; and the American Medical Association&amp;#39;s Board of Director&amp;#39;s Special Award for Meritorious Service in 1985. He created the John P. McGovern Foundation, valued at almost $200 million in 2005, and lent his name and financial support to many worthy Texas facilities, including the John P. McGovern Historical Collections and Research Center at the Texas Medical Center Library (the seat of NLM&amp;#39;s NN/LM South Central Region, at the Houston Academy of Medicine).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. McGovern is survived by his wife, Kathrine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;NLM has joined with the popular Hispanic television host Don Francisco to increase public awareness of and promote the Spanish-language version of MedlinePlus (&lt;a href="http://www.medlineplus.gov/salud"&gt;www.medlineplus.gov/salud&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Spanish-speaking communities are an important audience for MedlinePlus may be seen by the fact that surveys show more than 50% of adult Latinos in the U.S. use the Internet. More than half of those, in fact, look to the Web for medical and health information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don Francisco, the star of the well-liked TV variety show Sabado Gigante (Spanish for &amp;#34;Giant Saturday&amp;#34;) is teaming up with NLM to encourage Latinos to use MedlinePlus.gov en espaÃ±ol for their health information needs. MedlinePlus includes information on over 700 health topics, drug and herbal supplements, interactive tutorials, and health-related news stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Do you want to learn more about your health quickly and easily?&amp;#34; Francisco asks Latino TV and radio audiences in public services announcements to be released this May. He adds, &amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s simple. Visit MedlinePlus, the bilingual website with the most complete and reliable health information in the world.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Francisco, whose real name is Mario Kreutzberger, has often been described as the Spanish-speaking equivalent of Johnny Carson, Ed Sullivan, or David Letterman and Sabado Gigante is as popular among Latino audiences in the United States (where it airs on the Univision network) as it is in Spain and in countries all over Latin America. In fact, Sabado Gigante is so well known among Spanish-speaking viewers that President George W. Bush has appeared on the program twice - first in 2000 (when he was running against Al Gore), then in 2004 when Francisco interviewed both Bush and his Democratic rival, Massachusetts Senator John F. Kerry - who also recognized that a Sabado Gigante appearance was a perfect way to court Latino voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examples of Don Francisco&amp;#39;s public service announcements can be viewed at &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/outreach/donfrancisco.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/outreach/donfrancisco.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;PubMed Central (PMC), NLM&amp;#39;s free digital archive of full-text journal articles, reached the one million-article mark the week of June 18. The millionth article reportedly came from the American Journal of Pathology. Now in its seventh year, PMC is enhanced each week with articles from over 350 important life sciences journals whose publishers have agreed to deposit current issues. All of the content submitted to PMC is converted to a normalized electronic format for long-term storage and display on the web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the participating publishers have also benefited from the PMC Back Issue Digitization Project, where NLM scans older issues from cover to cover, starting with volume 1, and creates PubMed citations for articles that are not in PubMed. Jointly sponsored by the Wellcome Trust and Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) in the UK, the NLM scanning project has collected and collated over 5 million pages of material. As of June 2007, these scanned articles accounted for 675,000 of the million articles in PMC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of back issue digitization, several historically important works are now available in their entirety, including: Annals of Surgery from v.1, 1885; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the U.S.A. from v. 1, 1915; and all of the titles published by the American Society for Microbiology, including the Journal of Bacteriology, from v.1, 1916. This year, scanning was completed for the American Journal of Public Health v. 2 1912, and very soon BMJ will be available back to v. 1, 1857 along with all of the specialty journals published by the British Medical Association. Each of these titles continues to participate in PMC by submitting current content in full-text electronic form for every issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM is indebted to a wide range of publishers depositing electronically produced content to PMC and to a host of contributors to the back issue scanning project. Worldwide donations from libraries and associations of disposable back issues have assisted NLM with filling in journal volumes not supplied by publishers. While all donations are gratefully received, two institutions deserve special mention: the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA and Brown University in Providence, RI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The staff of NLM&amp;#39;s National Center for Biotechnology Information is responsible for the technical oversight of PMC and for the flow of current and scanned content, enabling PMC to grow exponentially each month. The staff of Library Operations manages contract activities, quality control and journal issue collection for the scanning project.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine is pleased to announce the 2007-2008 year of the leadership program jointly sponsored with the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries (AAHSL). The NLM/AAHSL Leadership Fellows Program is focused on preparing emerging leaders for the position of library director in academic health center libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;This collaboration of NLM and AAHSL is of exceptional value for the next generation of directors,&amp;#34; said AAHSL president Elaine Martin. &amp;#34;Our evaluation shows that the program has contributed to the quality of leadership in the profession.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellows will have the opportunity to develop their knowledge and skills in a variety of learning settings, including exposure to leadership in another environment. They will be paired with mentors who are academic health center library directors. In addition to the individual relationship with their mentors, fellows benefit from working collaboratively with other fellows and mentors. Experienced program faculty and mentors will provide content and facilitation for the cohort. The program takes advantage of flexible scheduling and an online learning community to minimize disruption to professional and personal schedules. The sponsors will provide financial support for up to five fellows and will underwrite travel and meeting expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty fellows and mentors have participated in the program since its inauguration in 2002. To date, five former fellows have assumed director positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The program helped sharpen my focus and convinced me that becoming a director was a worthwhile ambition,&amp;#34; noted Jett McCann, fellow, class of 2004-2005. &amp;#34;It exposed me to what a variety of directors actually do and how they work. The comradeship forged with my cohort colleagues continues; we are each others&amp;#39; best critics, advisers, and champions.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jerry Perry, fellow, class of 2002-2003, said, &amp;#34;It provided an opportunity to reflect and put my career goals into perspective. The relationship and dialogue I established with my program mentor serve as an ongoing source of insight and discovery, and I&amp;#39;m certain it will make me a better director.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karen Brewer, mentor, class of 2005-2006, stated, &amp;#34;We don&amp;#39;t often get the chance to reflect and discuss &amp;#39;directorship&amp;#39; in this way. I&amp;#39;ve learned as much from my fellow as she has from me.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Program Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one-year program design is multi-faceted: three in-person leadership institutes; attendance at an Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) annual meeting; a yearlong fellow/mentor relationship; Web-based courses and journal clubs on issues related to library leadership; and a two-week site visit to the mentor&amp;#39;s home library (in one or two-week segments).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program is designed to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduce fellows to leadership theory and practical tools for implementing change at organizational and professional levels;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduce fellows to critical issues facing academic health center libraries;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop meaningful professional relationships between fellows and mentors that give fellows access to career guidance and support;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expose fellows to another academic health center library and its institutional leadership under the guidance of their mentors;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examine career development and provide models of directors to fellows;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a cohort of leaders who will draw upon each other for support throughout their careers;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Promote diversity in the leadership of the profession; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Offer recognition to emerging leaders and enhance the competitive standing of fellows as they pursue director positions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM/AAHSL Leadership Fellows Program is currently accepting applications and nominations for the August 17, 2007, deadline for potential fellows and mentors for the 2007-2008 experience. Candidates for fellow should have a strong interest in pursuing a directorship in academic health center libraries, as well as a minimum of five years of department head level or higher responsibility, or equivalent experience, in an academic health center library, hospital library, or other library-related setting. Applications from qualified minority candidates are encouraged. Mentors should have at least five years&amp;#39; experience as director of an academic health center library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program brochure, including information on program design, schedule, and application process, is available at http://aahsl.org/document/NLM_AAHSL_Leadership_Fellows_2008.pdf. For more information about the program, please contact Carolyn Lipscomb, Project Manager, AAHSL Future Leadership Committee, &lt;a href="mailto:carolynlipscomb@cs.com"&gt;carolynlipscomb@cs.com&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tournez Les Pages&lt;/em&gt; Grants Greater Access to Treasures of Medical History&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vive la diffÃ©rence! With assistance from library colleagues in Paris, the National Library of Medicine is pleased to offer the Web version of its popular interactive program, &lt;em&gt;Turning The Pages&lt;/em&gt;, in French as well as English. This unique system, allowing users to &amp;#34;touch and turn&amp;#34; the digitized pages of rare historical volumes in a highly realistic way, is available on site at NLM and to users worldwide via the NLM home page, at www.nlm.nih.gov/turningthepages &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/turningthepages"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/turningthepages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turning The Pages&lt;/em&gt; gives users a virtual way of letting their fingers do the walking through treasures from the NLM collection - there are even page-turning sound effects, to enhance the experience - without posing any danger to these centuries-old items. Equipped with touch screen technology and animation software produced by NLM&amp;#39;s Lister Hill Center, the on-site &lt;em&gt;Turning The Pages&lt;/em&gt; kiosks at NLM allow a visitor to thumb through these beautiful old books virtually. In the Web version (&lt;em&gt;TTP Online&lt;/em&gt;), home users with an Internet connection may click and turn the pages from anywhere in the world. In both systems, patrons may magnify the pages for more detail, read or listen to explanations of the text and, in some cases, access additional information on the books in the form of curators&amp;#39; notes, from NLM&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM was able to launch &lt;em&gt;TTP Online&lt;/em&gt; in French (&lt;em&gt;Tournez Les Pages&lt;/em&gt;), thanks to translations done by M. Guy Cobolet, the director of the BibliothÃ¨que Interuniversitaire de MÃ©decine et d&amp;#39;Odontologie (BIUM), a large medical library in Paris. Tournez Les Pages offers explanations of the text, curators&amp;#39; notes and instructions for a francophone audience spread over Canada, Europe, North and West Africa, and in French-speaking pockets around the globe. On &lt;em&gt;TTP Online&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;s main introductory page, a user may click on an icon of the French tricolor to go to the equivalent page in French. VoilÃ !&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clicking on &lt;em&gt;Les Livres&lt;/em&gt; in the menu bar, the French-speaking user sees a list of five books, though only the first one currently has translations. This is by Ambroise ParÃ© (1510-1590), a French surgeon from humble beginnings who would revolutionize the way surgeons treated wounds. This 1585 edition of his &lt;em&gt;Oeuvres&lt;/em&gt; (Collected Works) is both his masterpiece and his monument, gathering together a lifetime&amp;#39;s experience and study. Translations for the other books are planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Calling All Muggles!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;NLM History of Medicine Division Launches a New Exhibition: &amp;#34;Medicine and Magic in Harry Potter&amp;#34;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free Screening of &amp;#34;&lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&amp;#39;s Stone,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#34; Friday, September 7th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, British writer J. K. Rowling published Harry Potter and the Philosopher&amp;#39;s Stone, the first in a series of seven books about a boy wizard who is the only known survivor of a &amp;#34;Killing Curse.&amp;#34; A year later the book was released in the United States with the title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&amp;#39;s Stone. Ms. Rowling&amp;#39;s books were soon breaking publishing records and &amp;#34;the boy who lived&amp;#34; became entrenched in the popular imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, there is more to the Harry Potter series than a child hero or a fantasy adventure--many characters, plants, and creatures are based in history, medicine, and magical lore. Ms Rowling has drawn on important works of alchemy and herbology in shaping her stories. In a special temporary exhibition, the History of Medicine Division showcases seven of the beautiful, centuries-old treasures in its collection that are mentioned in &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When:&lt;/strong&gt; Monday through Friday, 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM, through November 30, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where:&lt;/strong&gt; Inside the History of Medicine Division Reading Room, first floor, National Library of Medicine, Building 38, National Institutes of Health campus, Bethesda, Maryland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web site:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/mandrakes/"&gt;Do Mandrakes Really Scream? Magic and Medicine in Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt; at http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/mandrakes/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Information:&lt;/strong&gt; For directions, parking and security information, campus maps, etc., go to &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/visitor.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/visitor.html&lt;/a&gt; or call 301.496.5405.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To celebrate the exhibition, NLM is pleased to offer a free screening of the first movie in the Harry Potter series, &amp;#34;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&amp;#39;s Stone,&amp;#34; Friday, September 7th, in the Lister Hill Auditorium, NIH Building 38A. There will be light refreshments in the Lister Hill lobby at 5:30 PM, and the program will begin at 6:00 PM. All are welcome and parking is free. Please see &amp;#34;More Information,&amp;#34; above, for directions, maps and other information. Tours of the exhibition will also be provided at 5:30 PM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Image of Mandrake" border="1" height="296" src="/news/mandrake.jpg" width="220" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harry and his classmates learn about mandrakes in Herbology, in &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&lt;/em&gt;. Mandrake is the common name for the plant genus &lt;em&gt;Mandragora&lt;/em&gt;. All parts of the mandrake are poisonous, though its roots have historically been used in magic rituals. Mandrake roots appear to have arms and legs and resemble the human body. In fact, in many botanical texts, such as the one here, the mandrake root is drawn in the form of a human. Legend also states that when a mandrake root is pulled from the ground, it lets out a scream that is fatal to any listener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library, is part of the National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p class="bottom"&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Image of Microscope" border="4" height="150" hspace="5" src="/news/microscope.jpg" width="93" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The History of Medicine Division (HMD) of the National Library of Medicine is pleased to announce the opening of a new exhibit, Ã¢ÂÂHookeÃ¢ÂÂs Books: Books that Influenced or Were Influenced by Robert HookeÃ¢ÂÂs &lt;em&gt;Micrographia&lt;/em&gt;.Ã¢ÂÂ It is located in display cases in the HMD Reading Room, on the first floor of Building 38, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. The exhibit is open Monday through Friday, 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM, through November 1, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Hooke (1635-1703) was a remarkably versatile man Ã¢ÂÂ artist, biologist, physicist, engineer, architect, inventor, and more. However, his crowning glory was &lt;em&gt;Micrographia: or Some Physiological Descriptions of Minute Bodies made by Magnifying Glasses&lt;/em&gt;, first published 1665. It was a masterpiece Ã¢ÂÂ an exquisitely illustrated introduction to the previously unknown microscopic world. This exhibit focuses on HookeÃ¢ÂÂs influences and legacy in print, the pioneering books that stimulated HookeÃ¢ÂÂs research, and the works he left for others Ã¢ÂÂ most famously the great Dutch microscopist, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibit features a selection of books from the NLM collection, plus a facsimile of HookeÃ¢ÂÂs own microscope. It is a companion to NLMÃ¢ÂÂs latest Ã¢ÂÂTurning the PagesÃ¢ÂÂ production, a digital selection from &lt;em&gt;Micrographia&lt;/em&gt;, which can be viewed at &lt;a href="http://ttp.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://ttp.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For directions, parking and security information, campus maps, etc., go to &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/visitor.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/visitor.html&lt;/a&gt; or call 301.402-8878.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The History of Medicine Division (HMD) of the National Library of Medicine is pleased to announce the launch of a new website featuring historical literature on cholera: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/cholera/index.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/cholera/index.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholera is an acute, painful, and often fatal disease which ravaged populations all over the world in several pandemics during the 19th century. News of its spread and impending approach often sent panic into entire nations, and health professionals were largely at a loss as to how to treat or prevent it until modern epidemiological and laboratory techniques were developed later in the century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine has so far scanned over 100 English language pamphlets dating from 1817 to 1890 dealing with the cholera pandemics of that period. The selection of cholera was in part inspired by the 315-page &amp;#34;Bibliography of Cholera&amp;#34; compiled by John Shaw Billings in 1875 for the report by John M. Woodworth&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Cholera Epidemic of 1873 in the United States&lt;/em&gt;. This extensive bibliography by Billings meant to include all published monographs and journal articles &amp;#34;which relate mainly or entirely to cholera.&amp;#34; The bibliography was a precursor, perhaps a &amp;#34;pilot project,&amp;#34; to the great &lt;em&gt;Index Catalogue of the Library of the Surgeon General&amp;#39;s Office&lt;/em&gt;, which began coming out in 1880.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, the Library plans to scan nearly 400 English language items on cholera from its collections, making it one of the most comprehensive online collections of cholera literature available anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, please contact Michael North, Head, Rare Books and Early Manuscripts, &lt;a href="mailto:northm@mail.nih.gov"&gt;northm@mail.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt; or 301-496-9204.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authoritative Volume Clears Up Questions Regarding Print and Electronic Medical Information &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When an online journal article comes out in multiple versions, which one(s) do you cite?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If youÃ¢ÂÂre citing a reference from a blog or a wiki, what exactly constitutes the publisher and what constitutes the publication? (And what if you have no idea of the city from which it was issued?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If youÃ¢ÂÂre working with a printed medical journal, on the other hand, and you know itÃ¢ÂÂs published in New York City, should you go with &amp;#34;New York (NY)&amp;#34; or just &amp;#34;New York&amp;#34; in your citation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 21st century, technological advances have created a whole new world of medical citations. To give authors, editors, medical librarians and others a guidebook for navigating that world, the National Library of Medicine is pleased to announce the publication of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/citingmedicine"&gt;Citing Medicine: the NLM Style Guide for Authors, Editors, and Publishers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, available free of charge on the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books"&gt;NCBI Bookshelf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Citing Medicine&lt;/em&gt; provides guidance for citing 26 types of published and unpublished material, ranging from print books and journal articles to blogs and wikis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors will find this a great resource for producing reference lists as they prepare articles and books for publication. Editors and librarians now have easy access to authoritative citation information, and publishers may discover useful guidelines to incorporate into their instructions for authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Citing Medicine&lt;/em&gt; updates and supersedes two previous NLM publications, &lt;em&gt;National Library of Medicine Recommended Formats for Bibliographic Citation&lt;/em&gt; published in 1991 and its &lt;em&gt;Internet Supplement&lt;/em&gt; published in 2001. These publications will be archived on the NLM Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This new edition:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers more types of publications, including a variety of Internet publications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contains more introductory material for each type of publication&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes more example citations which users consistently requested&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is published in HTML format and will be printable from Adobe Acrobat pdf format later this fall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;# # # # #&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, October 11, the National Library of Medicine released a new search engine for &lt;a href="http://medlineplus.gov/"&gt;MedlinePlus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://medlineplus.gov/spanish/"&gt;MedlinePlus en espaÃ±ol&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;NLM Library Web site&lt;/a&gt;. NLM has made this change to better meet the expectations and preferences of the millions of people who use NLM Web sites each month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After extensive research, NLM selected search engine software from the Pittsburgh-based company &lt;a href="http://vivisimo.com"&gt;Vivisimo&lt;/a&gt;. Vivisimo is also the current search solution for the &lt;a href="http://www.usa.gov/"&gt;www.usa.gov&lt;/a&gt; site (formerly FirstGov), which contains online information from the entire spectrum of U.S. government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new search results feature enhanced relevance rankings and boldface search words in context, to help users select the best Web documents for their queries. An integrated spell checker suggests alternative search terms and spelling corrections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new search engine also expands queries using synonyms specific to the sites and medical synonyms from the NLM &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/umls.html"&gt;Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The default display for search results is a comprehensive list of &amp;#34;All Results,&amp;#34; from all areas of the site. Users can also focus their search on one part of the site by navigating to individual collections of results, such as &amp;#34;Drugs and Supplements,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Medical Encyclopedia,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Online Exhibits&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;NLM Web Archives.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For searches that retrieve one of the 700+ English-language health topics on MedlinePlus, the relevant topic will be spotlighted at the top of the screen with an image, an excerpt of the health topic summary and links to the topic, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Lung Diseases spotlight example" height="200" src="spotlight_lungdiseases.gif" width="650" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Searches on the Library Web site for an NLM product or service will highlight the relevant results in the &amp;#34;NLM Selected Resources&amp;#34; box at the top of the results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Interlibrary Loan Selected Resources example" height="135" src="keymatch_ill.gif" width="650" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Library plans to implement the Vivisimo search engine on &lt;a href="http://nihseniorhealth.gov"&gt;NIHSeniorHealth&lt;/a&gt;, MedlinePlus Go Local, and other sites in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;# # # # #&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;NLM&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division and its Images and Archives Section are &amp;#34;Celebrating the American Record of Health and Medicine&amp;#34; as part of American Archives Month, with a web site &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/collections/archives/dmp/archivesmonth/index.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/collections/archives/dmp/archivesmonth/index.html&lt;/a&gt; and a bulletin board that highlight our programs and collections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM&amp;#39;s Image and Archives Section has important collections that document American health and medicine. The Archives and Modern Manuscripts Collections have far-ranging holdings on military medicine, public health, molecular biology, mental health, and surgery. The Prints and Photographs Collections, with over 60,000 images online, are strong in medical portraiture, images of health care and health institutions, fine prints with medical themes, and public health posters. The Historical Audiovisuals Collection has over 5,000 instructional films, public service announcements, and documentaries. The Digital Manuscripts Program produces &amp;#34;Profiles in Science,&amp;#34; some 25 sites chronicling, through documents and photographs, modern American biomedical research and public health. Our programs also include the On-line Syllabus Archive on teaching resources in the history of medicine and allied disciplines, and public activities such as the &amp;#34;Cartoon Medicine Show,&amp;#34; highlighting our film collections. Images and Archives collections are available to all who want to know more about the ways that medicine, dentistry, nursing, public health, and related fields have shaped American society and culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Archives Month is a collaborative effort by professional organizations and repositories around the nation to highlight the importance of records of enduring value. Archivists are professionals who assess, collect, organize, preserve, maintain control of, and provide access to information that has lasting value, and they help people find and understand the information they need in those records. The event is sponsored by the Society of American Archivists &lt;a href="http://archivists.org/"&gt;http://archivists.org/&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, please contact Paul Theerman, Head, Images and Archives, at &lt;a href="mailto:paul_theerman@nlm.nih.gov"&gt;paul_theerman@nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;When was the first heart transplanted in a human? What does an artificial heart look like? Once implanted, is an artificial heart permanent? What does the space program have to do with artificial organs? Can an artificial gill allow humans to live like fish? A bear can live for long periods of time without kidneys. Can a human? What are the physical obstacles for using artificial organs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answers to these and other questions about organ and transplant research will be heard at an upcoming symposium, the Michael E. DeBakey* Seminar in Medicine, Thursday, December 6, 2007, at the Texas Medical Center&amp;#39;s Edwin Hornberger Conference Center, Houston, TX, from 9:00 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. This is the fifth in a series of seminars to be convened by NIH&amp;#39;s National Library of Medicine. Washington, DC, Chicago, IL, and New York City hosted previous seminars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Developments and advances are occurring at incredible speed--all directed toward improving human health and the quality of life,&amp;#34; noted Donald A.B. Lindberg, M.D,. Director of the National Library of Medicine, a part of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD. He added, &amp;#34;I know that the presentations you hear today will kindle even greater interest, and I can ensure an exciting and fulfilling career to those who pursue this interest.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seminar will bring together top scientists and medical doctors in cardiac surgery and the organ and transplant field to discuss and demonstrate the latest advances in research.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Bethesda, Md.)--&lt;/strong&gt;The National Library of Medicine announces the release of an extensive selection from the papers of the biochemist and science advocate Maxine Frank Singer on its Profiles in Science Web site. The Maxine Singer project is a collaboration with the Library of Congress, the repository of her papers. With this addition the number of prominent researchers, public health officials, and promoters of medical research whose personal and professional records are presented on Profiles has grown to twenty-five. The site is at &lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a career spanning nearly six decades, Singer has made important contributions to the deciphering of the genetic code and to our understanding of the synthesis and structure of RNA and DNA, the chemical elements of heredity. She championed the cause of women and minorities in science and built innovative programs to improve science education. Singer also took a leading role in devising safety guidelines for the controversial new technology of recombinant DNA in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;For many years, Maxine Singer has been an inspiring leader in research and in public discourse over the ethical and political responsibilities of scientists,&amp;#34; says Donald A. B. Lindberg, MD, director of the National Library of Medicine. Neither academia nor industry were welcoming to women scientists at the time Singer enrolled at Swarthmore as a chemistry major in 1948. But she had the fortune of finding supportive mentors there, at Yale while earning her Ph.D., and at the National Institute of Arthritis, Metabolism, and Digestive Diseases, which she joined as a postdoctoral fellow in 1956 and where she would remain until 1975.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of James Watson and Francis Crick&amp;#39;s discovery of the double-helical structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), Singer entered the emerging field of nucleic acid chemistry, a decision that brought her to the forefront of the new science of molecular biology. The artificial RNA polymers she produced with Leon Heppel in the course of their work on the structure and synthesis of ribonucleic acid (RNA) enabled Marshall Nirenberg and Heinrich Matthaei to unravel the genetic code in the early 1960s. Singer subsequently studied genetic recombination in defective animal viruses and the structure of the chromosomal DNA-protein complex called chromatin. In the 1980s, she discovered that repeated DNA sequences called LINES (long interspersed repeated sequences) are mobile genetic elements that can jump from place to place on chromosomes in mammalian cells, sometimes inducing genetic mutations that cause disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the early 1970s, as debate over the potential risks of the first gene recombination experiments grew ever more heated, Maxine Singer was a leading voice in balancing scientific principles and public welfare. Recombinant DNA research promised to revolutionize the understanding of genetics, but because they involved manipulation of genes, scientists and laymen alike worried that these experiments might produce new pathogens that could endanger human health or irrevocably alter the environment. Singer helped organize the landmark Asilomar Conference in February 1975, at which scientists agreed to impose restrictions on this research, and to develop a framework for removing these restrictions as knowledge of the science advanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1975, Singer joined the National Cancer Institute, rising to chief of the Laboratory of Biochemistry in 1980. In 1988 she was elected president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, one of the nation&amp;#39;s preeminent private research organizations in biology, astronomy, and the earth sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singer&amp;#39;s many honors include election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1978) and the National Academy of Sciences (1979). In 1992, she was awarded the National Medal of Science, the nation&amp;#39;s highest scientific honor. Singer has written over a hundred scientific articles and has co-authored several books, including Genes and Genomes (1991) and Dealing with Genes (1993).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profiles in Science was launched September 1998 by the National Library of Medicine, a part of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., a constituent agency of the Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;True crime murder pamphlets in the collection of the National Library of Medicine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The History of Medicine Division (HMD) of the National Library of Medicine is pleased to announce the opening of a new exhibit, &amp;#34;MOST HORRIBLE &amp;#38; SHOCKING MURDERS: True crime murder pamphlets in the collection of the National Library of Medicine.&amp;#34; It is located in display cases in the HMD Reading Room, on the first floor of the National Library of Medicine, Building 38, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. The exhibit is open Monday through Friday, 8:30am to 5:00pm, and Saturday 8:30am to 2:30pm, through June 15, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since the mid-1400s, the public&amp;#39;s appetite for tales of shocking murders-&amp;#34;true crime&amp;#34;-has been one of the most durable facts of the market for printed material. Murder pamphlets were hawked on street corners, taverns, coffeehouses, newsstands, and bookshops. Typically, the pamphlets claimed to be true accounts of a murder, consisting of a narrative, trial transcript, or written confession of the murderer before his or her execution. Sometimes they featured medical commentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pamphlets on display in &amp;#34;MOST HORRIBLE &amp;#38; SHOCKING MURDERS&amp;#34; were printed between 1692 and 1881. Some deal with cases of interest to the emerging field of forensic medicine. Others deal with cases in which doctors were accused of-or were victims of-heinous crimes. Still others have no medical connection whatsoever. Today, murder pamphlets are a rich source for historians and crime novelists, who mine them to study the history of medicine, class, gender, the law, the city, religion and other topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibit was curated by Michael Sappol, PhD. For further information on the exhibit, contact Stephen Greenberg, e-mail greenbes@mail.nih.gov, phone 301-435-4995. Due to current security measures at NIH, off-campus visitors are advised to consult the NIH Visitors and Security website at: &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/about/visitorsecurity.htm"&gt;http://www.nih.gov/about/visitorsecurity.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen J.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) has been honored as an innovator for developing tools that help doctors around the world collaborate in cancer research. NLM received a 2008 Internet2 Driving Exemplary Applications (IDEA) Award. Internet2 is a consortium of universities, companies, government, and research labs. The IDEA awards recognize innovators who have created and deployed advanced network applications that have enabled transformational progress in research, teaching, and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM was recognized for its geography-independent cancer research tools. The library is developing advanced network-based tools and techniques that leverage the speed and capability of research networks like Internet2 to enable doctors from around the world to more effectively participate in cancer research studies and enable more comprehensive analysis of cancer research data. These tools have transformed the way geographically distant cancer researchers are able to collaborate. For example, more than 40 researchers and medical professionals in six countries have conducted more than 10 studies in two years, which has significantly benefited the field. While these breakthrough tools are currently being utilized for cervical cancer research, there is significant potential for extending their use broadly in the biomedical field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Advanced research networks such as Internet2 could not be more critical in the global enterprise to address the world&amp;#39;s health by enabling geographically distant researchers and health care workers to collaborate remotely,&amp;#34; said George Thoma, chief, Communications Engineering Branch, U.S. National Library of Medicine. &amp;#34;The tools include systems to store thousands of images and longitudinal patient records, and provide access to these images by shape, color and texture features. The focus of current research is to study cervical cancer caused by the Human Papillomavirus, but other research areas are planned.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awards were presented at Internet2&amp;#39;s 2008 Spring Member Meeting. Thoma, Sameer Antani and L. Rodney Long of NLM and Marck Schiffman of the National Cancer Institute collaborated on the award-winning work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) today announced that it is granting emergency responders electronic access to the &lt;em&gt;Emergency Response Guidebook 2008 (ERG2008)&lt;/em&gt;, through laptops and personal digital assistants (PDAs), under a joint effort between DOT&amp;#39;s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the National Library of Medicine (NLM), the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health. This new hazmat safety guide for police, fire and other emergency response organizations is designed to aid emergency response personnel who may be the first to arrive at the scene of a transportation incident involving hazardous materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM-developed software application and NLM&amp;#39;s Wireless Information System for Emergency Responders (WISER) software are stand-alone applications for Pocket PCs, PDAs, and Windows-based laptop computers. This joint effort keeps pace with the advance of portable personal technology and fulfills the request of a number of emergency responders for an electronic-based ERG. DOT is also distributing nearly 1.75 million print copies of the ERG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;In the first critical moments of a hazmat incident, the ERG is an invaluable reference tool to first responders that helps save lives,&amp;#34; said Carl T. Johnson, Administrator of DOT&amp;#39;s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. &amp;#34;The option of having the ERG available either in hard copy or electronically increases responder flexibility.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidebook is a joint project between the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), Transport Canada, the Secretariat of Transport and Communications of Mexico, and includes the collaboration of CIQUIME of Argentina. The book provides guidance to first responders on how to identify the types of hazardous materials that may be involved in an incident and how to respond to the threats those materials might pose to emergency crews and the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on the ERG2008, or to download the ERG and WISER software application, visit &lt;a href="http://hazmat.dot.gov/"&gt;http://hazmat.dot.gov&lt;/a&gt;, or call (202) 366-4900. Print copies of the ERG are also available commercially through the U.S. Government Printing Office Bookstore and other commercial vendors. For information on NLM&amp;#39;s WISER software, visit &lt;a href="http://wiser.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://wiser.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine is pleased to announce the 2008-2009 year of the leadership program jointly sponsored with the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries (AAHSL). The NLM/AAHSL Leadership Fellows Program is focused on preparing emerging leaders for the position of library director in academic health sciences libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;This collaboration of NLM and AAHSL is of exceptional value for the next generation of directors, and the program has benefited both fellows and mentors,&amp;#34; said AAHSL president Linda Watson. &amp;#34;Our evaluation shows that it has contributed to the quality of leadership in the profession.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellows will have the opportunity to develop their knowledge and skills in a variety of learning settings, including exposure to leadership in another environment. They will be paired with mentors who are academic health sciences library directors. In addition to the individual relationship with their mentors, fellows benefit from working collaboratively with other fellows and mentors. Experienced program faculty and mentors will provide content and facilitation for the cohort. The program takes advantage of flexible scheduling and an online learning community to minimize disruption to professional and personal schedules. The sponsors will provide financial support for up to five fellows and will underwrite travel and meeting expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty fellows have participated in the program since its inauguration in 2002. To date, seven former fellows have assumed director positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The program helped sharpen my focus and convinced me that becoming a director was a worthwhile ambition,&amp;#34; noted Jett McCann, fellow, class of 2004-2005, and director at Georgetown University. &amp;#34;It exposed me to what a variety of directors actually do and how they work. The comradeship forged with my cohort colleagues continues; we are each others&amp;#39; best critics, advisers, and champions.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jerry Perry, fellow, class of 2002-2003, and director at University of Colorado, said, &amp;#34;It provided an opportunity to reflect and put my career goals into perspective. The relationship and dialogue I established with my program mentor serve as an ongoing source of insight and discovery, and I&amp;#39;m certain it will make me a better director.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judith Robinson, mentor, class of 2007-2008, and assistant dean at Eastern Virginia, stated, &amp;#34;As a new mentor in the program, I was thrilled with the opportunity to work in such a collaborative environment with the fellows and other mentors. The experiences with external experts and the chance to work closely with my fellow resulted in one of my most rewarding years as a director.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Program Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one-year program design is multi-faceted: three in-person leadership institutes; attendance at an Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) annual meeting; a yearlong fellow/mentor relationship; Web-based courses and discussions on issues related to library leadership; and a two-week site visit to the mentor&amp;#39;s home library (in one or two-week segments).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program is designed to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduce fellows to leadership theory and practical tools for implementing change at organizational and professional levels;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduce fellows to critical issues facing academic health sciences libraries;Â·&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop meaningful professional relationships between fellows and mentors that give fellows access to career guidance and support;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expose fellows to another academic health sciences library and its institutional leadership under the guidance of their mentors;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examine career development and provide models of directors to fellows;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a cohort of leaders who will draw upon each other for support throughout their careers;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Promote diversity in the leadership of the profession; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Offer recognition to emerging leaders and enhance the competitive standing of fellows as they pursue director positions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM/AAHSL Leadership Fellows Program is currently accepting applications and nominations for the August 1, 2008, deadline for potential fellows and mentors for the 2008-2009 experience. Candidates for fellow should have a strong interest in pursuing a directorship in academic health sciences libraries, as well as a minimum of five years of department head level or higher responsibility, or equivalent experience, in an academic health sciences library, hospital library, or other library-related setting. Applications from qualified minority candidates are encouraged. Mentors should have at least five years&amp;#39; experience as director of an academic health sciences library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program brochure, including information on program design, schedule, and application process, is available at ( http://aahsl.org/Applications_Awards_Scholarships/NLM_AAHSL2008-2009rev.pdf) For more information about the program, please contact Carolyn Lipscomb, Program Manager, AAHSL Future Leadership Committee, (&lt;a href="mailto:carolynlipscomb@cs.com"&gt;carolynlipscomb@cs.com&lt;/a&gt;) .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Michael DeBakey, who died Friday, July 11th of natural causes, was one of the 20th century&amp;#39;s great pioneers of cardiovascular surgery. He was the chancellor emeritus of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, director of The Methodist DeBakey Heart &amp;#38; Vascular Center, and senior attending surgeon of The Methodist Hospital in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What many may not know about this celebrated figure (whom medical historian Dr. Sherwin Nuland has said was, &amp;#34;without question, the greatest surgeon of all time&amp;#34;) was that he was also one of National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s most stalwart supporters. DeBakey played a pivotal role in the creation of the Library in the 1950s and in the establishment of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine in the 1960s. A visionary member and chair of the NLM Board of Regents and several other NLM advisory panels, the surgeon, innovator, medical educator and medical statesman made countless contributions to the Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM Director Dr. Donald A.B. Lindberg, quoted in The Houston Chronicle, July 13, 2008, observed, &amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s an overused phrase, but Dr. DeBakey was truly a Renaissance man of medicine. He knew how to ask the most basic, common-sensical questions that got to the heart of a matter, and he saw the whole picture.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;The heart of the matter&amp;#34; is the perfect choice of words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of only a handful of surgeons to become well-known to an international audience, DeBakey performed more than 60,000 operations, and routine procedures such as bypass surgery owe much to his example. He also invented and improved a series of devices now routinely used in the treatment of heart patients. These included artificial hearts, heart pumps to assist those waiting for transplants, and more than 50 instruments, including the DeBakey clamps and the DeBakey forceps used by vascular surgeons around the world. But the Dacron graft, used to treat diseased arteries, remains his greatest innovation, according to medical historians. These grafts are used to repair aneurysms, or ballooning, in all parts of the aorta and are now part of standard treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This inventor and innovator earned a reputation as the greatest surgeon alive when he was just 35, but his curiosity and considerable skills had him making important contributions to medicine well into the 21st century. As his reputation grew, so did the list of famous people who sought his advice and services. Among them were the Duke of Windsor, the Shah of Iran, King Hussein of Jordan, Boris Yeltsin, and Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Ellis DeBakey (originally &amp;#34;Debaghi,&amp;#34; but later Anglicized) was born September 7, 1908, in Lake Charles, Louisiana. One of five children of Lebanese immigrants, he attributed his surgical skills to his mother, who had taught him to sew and knit. He earned a science degree from Tulane University in New Orleans and, in 1932, received an MD degree from the Tulane University School of Medicine. From 1935 to 1937, DeBakey studied in Europe, at Strasbourg and Heidelberg universities, before returning to Tulane to teach surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late in life, he recalled that, in 1932, the year the finished medical school, &amp;#34;there was virtually nothing you could do for heart disease. If a patient came in with a heart attack, it was up to God.&amp;#34; This was unacceptable to the creative young surgeon and, that same year, he developed a roller pump that would become an important component of heart-lung machines used in open heart surgery, fulfilling the function of the heart by supplying oxygenated blood to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That extraordinary gift for innovation (often against the prevailing medical wisdom of the day) was to become characteristic of Dr. DeBakey&amp;#39;s career. He was among the first to recognize the importance of blood banks and transfusions, and to publicize a link between smoking and lung cancer. He also developed the mobile army surgical hospital or MASH unit, created a follow-up system for veterans&amp;#39; health problems which evolved into the Veterans Affairs hospital system, and chartered the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chronology of Dr. DeBakey&amp;#39;s involvement with NLM and its antecedents follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the 1940s, during World War II, Dr. DeBakey spent many hours in the Army Medical Library, located on Independence Avenue, on the National Mall. Researching military medical matters required by his duties in the Army Surgeon General&amp;#39;s Office, he was dismayed by the deplorable physical conditions: the lighting was bad, the roof leaked, etc. He was especially concerned about the deterioration of the collection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After the war, it became clear that, if the collection was to get the attention it deserved, the library should be transferred from the military to the civilian sphere. &amp;#34;From the point of view of the military command,&amp;#34; Dr. DeBakey noted, &amp;#34;the library had minuscule significance by comparison with a tank, battleship, or airplane.&amp;#34;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the decade following the war, Michael DeBakey was involved with a number of Congressional committees, task forces, and, most notably, the Second Hoover Commission. He was persuasive with influential advisors and worked with Senators Lister Hill and John F. Kennedy. Eventually, in 1956, the Congress created the National Library of Medicine by transferring the Armed Forces Medical Library into the Department of Health Education and Welfare. Before this could happen, however, DeBakey had to pull some strings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. DeBakey thought the library should be near government researchers in Bethesda, but James A. Shannon, the NIH director at the time, did not agree. Dr. DeBakey convinced him otherwise by asking Dr. Shannon how he started his pioneering kidney research at New York University. By reading in the library, Dr. Shannon replied.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That wasn&amp;#39;t the end of the story. The American Medical Association wanted the library built next to its headquarters in Chicago. With little public interest in the issue, House Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas held up the bill backing the Bethesda site, which was sponsored by Senator Lister Hill of Alabama. (NLM&amp;#39;s research and development facility, the Lister Hill Center, NIH Building 38A, now bears his name.) In a strategic masterstroke, Dr. DeBakey contacted the secretary of the national Democratic Party, Dorothy Vredenberg. DeBakey had once operated on her husband and he called in his marker, to ask for her help. The next day, she told DeBakey that Mr. Rayburn would let the bill through.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. DeBakey was a member (and elected chair) of the founding Board of Regents (1956).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He chaired President Johnson&amp;#39;s Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer and Stroke. One outcome from that influential body was the passage of the Medical Library Assistance Act and the creation of a Regional Medical Library Network (1965), now known as the National Network of Libraries of Medicine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High on Dr. DeBakey&amp;#39;s list of achievements is a Houston high school he helped start in 1983 for students (mostly minorities) seeking health care careers. The school is now named for him, and NLM has worked closely with it through the years, sponsoring special programs in Texas and bringing students and teachers to the NIH campus. Using Dr. DeBakey&amp;#39;s model, NLM has recently sponsored programs in cities, to interest high schoolers in careers in health and medicine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. DeBakey was a member of the original Long Range Planning Panel for Building and Organizing the Library&amp;#39;s Collection (1986).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Michael DeBakey was a tireless advocate for NLM in the public press and made several Public Service Announcements (PSAs) as part of its outreach efforts to the public. In 1987, he wrote an article about the Library in Readers&amp;#39; Digest, which had a circulation of 16 million at the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He chaired the Outreach Long Range Planning Panel whose 1989 report (Improving Health Professionals&amp;#39; Access to Information) still influences NLM&amp;#39;s public information and outreach activities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. DeBakey was appointed to another term on the Board of Regents, from 1994 to 1998. Again, he served a term as chair.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over the years, Michael DeBakey repeatedly testified before Congress on behalf of NLM and its programs. In 1997, he told the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services about the potential benefits of offering free access to MEDLINE via the Web. He secured their support for NLM providing that service. In that testimony, the visionary man of medicine also recommended that the Library broaden the scope of its databases to include authoritative health information intended for the public, thus laying the foundation for MedlinePlus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NLM hosted a 90th birthday party for Dr. DeBakey in 1998. Before a throng of well wishers, he was presented with a brick from the old Army Medical Library and honored with thunderous applause.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;# # #&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;An Iconography of Contagion: 20th-Century Health Posters in the Collection of the National Library of Medicine,&amp;#34; an exhibition at the National Academy of Sciences, organized in collaboration with the National Library of Medicine (NIH), will be on display from Sept. 2 - Dec. 19 at the National Academy of Sciences, 2100 C St., NW, Washington, DC (nearest Metro stop: Foggy Bottom). It is open to the public from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays; admission is free; photo ID is required for admittance. Public health took a visual turn about 100 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an era of devastating epidemic and endemic infectious disease, health professionals began to organize coordinated campaigns that sought to mobilize public and government action through eye-catching posters, pamphlets, and motion pictures. Impressed by the images of mass media that increasingly saturated the world around them, health campaigners were inspired to present new figures of contagion, and recycle old ones, using modernist aesthetics, graphic manipulations, humor, dramatic lighting, painterly abstraction, distortions of perspective, and other visual strategies. They devised a new iconography of contagion that emphasized visual legibility and the pleasure of the view. This exhibition features more than 20 health posters from the 1920s to the 1990s, from North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. It covers infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS, gonorrhea, and syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The posters show the interplay between public understanding of disease and social values. They reflect the fears and concerns of the time, and the state of medical knowledge. And they show how beautiful and entertaining images and designs were used to educate the public on matters of life and death. Curator Michael Sappol, National Library of Medicine medical historian, will give a free gallery talk on Thursday, Sept. 18, from 6 pm to 8 pm at the National Academy of Sciences, 2100 C St., NW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Press Contact: Alana Quinn, Outreach Manager Cultural Programs, National Academy of Sciences 202-334-2415; e-mail &lt;a href="mailto:aquinn@nas.edu"&gt;aquinn@nas.edu&lt;/a&gt; Public Contact: 202-334-2436; e-mail &lt;a href="mailto:arts@nas.edu"&gt;arts@nas.edu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NIH has prohibited smoking inside or in close proximity to buildings on the NIH campus for many years. Effective Wednesday, October 1, 2008, NIH will extend this prohibition to the full extent of the campus and become a tobacco-free facility. Use of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, smokeless tobacco, and any other tobacco products will be prohibited both indoors and outdoors on the Bethesda campus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This news was delivered in a recent memorandum from NIH Director Elias A. Zerhouni, MD. Dr. Zerhouni notes that, on November 10, 2004, the Secretary of Health and Human Services announced the Tobacco-Free HHS initiative. This policy requires that all properties owned or leased by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies be tobacco-free to the extent that labor and lease agreements permit. With this new policy, NIH will comply with that HHS directive. NIH is the nation&amp;#39;s medical research agency. As Dr. Zerhouni writes in his memo:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Our mission is science in the pursuit of fundamental knowledge that will advance medicine and prevent disease. When we established a Web site for the NIH tobacco-free effort, we titled it, &amp;#39;Taking Our Own Best Advice.&amp;#39; We want a healthy and productive community. For those who have never used tobacco products or who have set them aside at an earlier time, please show compassion and understanding toward those who are stopping now. Thank you for your compliance with this important policy.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Full text of memorandum at http://www.nih.gov/about/director/tobaccofree_memo.html.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NIH Tobacco-Free Web site (&lt;a href="http://tobaccofree.nih.gov/"&gt;http://tobaccofree.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt;) offers information about smoking cessation programs, educational materials, and answers to your questions about the tobacco-free policy. There is also a link on the site for sending e-mail to ask any additional questions. NLM&amp;#39;s consumer-friendly MedlinePlus Web site also offers tips on quitting smoking, at &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/smokingcessation.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/smokingcessation.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health (NIH) today announced an expanded ClinicalTrials.gov database. The database will accept basic results information, in addition to trial registrations. Due to growing public interest and a desire for improved access to clinical trial information and greater transparency in clinical research, Congress enacted Title VIII of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA, Public Law 110-85, section 801). In response to this new legislative mandate, those responsible for conducting clinical trials will submit data after the trial is completed. The enhanced database will provide summary results statistics for a broad range of trials of drugs, medical devices and biological products that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Patient-identifiable information will not be included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Providing scientists, physicians, and the public with results information could go a long way toward improving safety,&amp;#34; said Director Elias Zerhouni, M.D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials are research studies that test how well new medical approaches work in people. Each study answers specific scientific questions and tries to find better ways to prevent, screen for, diagnose, or treat a disease. Since 2000, ClinicalTrials.gov, the largest single registry of clinical trials, has provided patients, families and members of the public with easy access to information about a trial&amp;#39;s purpose, who may participate, locations, and phone numbers for more details. This Web site currently has information on nearly 62,000 ongoing and completed trials sponsored by the U.S. Federal government, pharmaceutical industry, academic, and international organizations with locations in all 50 States and in 157 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;In time, the results database will be a powerful tool for researchers and health care consumers alike, and will have untold benefits for the public health too.&amp;#34; said Donald A.B. Lindberg, M.D., Director of the NIH&amp;#39;s National Library of Medicine which developed and administers the new results database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results information will be integrated into the clinical trial records that can be reached at &lt;a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/"&gt;http://clinicaltrials.gov/&lt;/a&gt;, and through its consumer health information service, MedlinePlus, at &lt;a href="http://medlineplus.gov"&gt;http://medlineplus.gov&lt;/a&gt;. MedlinePlus has extensive links to information about 750 diseases and health conditions, much of it from the NIH Institutes and Centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health (NIH) -- The Nation&amp;#39;s Medical Research Agency -- includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It is the primary federal agency for conducting and supporting basic, clinical and translational medical research, and it investigates the causes, treatments, and cures for both common and rare diseases. For more information about NIH and its programs, visit &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov"&gt;www.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Located in Bethesda, Md., the National Library of Medicine is the world&amp;#39;s largest library of the health sciences. For more information, visit the Web site at &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Title VIII of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA, Public Law 110-85, section 801) enacted on September 27, 2007, expanded the scope of trials and information required to be submitted to Clinical Trials.gov and required the submission of results data. This system builds on the existing ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration System and allows sponsors and principal investigators to clinical trials to submit &amp;#34;basic results&amp;#34; summary data necessary to satisfy statutory requirements. Submission will be publicly posted on ClinicalTrials.gov (&lt;a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/"&gt;http://clinicaltrials.gov/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information contact:&lt;br /&gt;Kathleen Cravedi&lt;br /&gt;301-496-6308&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:cravedik@nlm.nih.gov"&gt;cravedik@nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Paul. G. Rogers, a retired US congressman known as &amp;#34;Mr. Health&amp;#34; for his leading role in passing dozens of measures promoting health care and the environment, died October 13 at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, DC. He had lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Paul Rogers" border="0" height="250" hspace="15" src="/news/14941.jpg" vspace="3" width="250" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rogers served for 24 years as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, retiring in 1979. In the 1960s and 1970s, he was an ardent supporter of the National Library of Medicine on Capitol Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, as a result of the &amp;#34;Rogers Report,&amp;#34; emanating from the House Subcommittee on Reorganization, which he chaired, NLM established a research center for biomedical communications. That led to the Joint Resolution of the Congress that created the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications in 1968. That resolution also called for the construction of a new facility, the Lister Hill Center (Building 38A).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rogers was also an advisor to NLM Director Dr. Donald A.B. Lindberg&amp;#39;s long-range planning initiatives in the mid-1980s. In 1989, he served on the Library&amp;#39;s Outreach Planning Panel, which issued an influential report on the importance of improving the dissemination of health information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Paul Rogers was one of the best friends the National Library of Medicine ever had,&amp;#34; noted NLM Director Lindberg. &amp;#34;This courtly gentleman was at the same time an aggressive advocate for medical research. Although he hadn&amp;#39;t trained in medicine himself, he had an uncanny ability to see the potential that medical research offered. He was always looking to the future and always had big, powerful ideas. We will miss him sorely.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As chair of the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment in his last eight years of office, Paul Rogers racked up a remarkable record of achievements in health policy. These include: the Migrant Health Act; the Clean Air Act; the Health Manpower Training Act; the National Cancer Act; the Heart, Lung, and Blood Act; the Emergency Medical Services Act; the Community Health Centers Act; the Medicare-Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments; and the National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Rogers received the Distinguished Service Award from the NLM Board of Regents February 10, 2004. In presenting him with that honor, then-Board chair Eugenie Pride remarked, &amp;#34;The National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Act, passed in 1976, is especially relevant to what we at the National Library of Medicine are today engaged in. For in it, we can see that Paul Rogers was an early proponent of the idea that the federal government has a responsibility to disseminate information directly to the public for the improvement of the public health.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After leaving Capitol Hill, Rogers helped create the nonprofit Friends of the National Library of Medicine (FNLM) in 1986, to promote, publicize and support the Library. In his role as chair, the former legislator developed that coalition of individuals, medical associations and societies, hospitals, health science libraries, corporations and foundations into a meaningful and productive body. One of its crowning achievements was &lt;em&gt;NIH Medline&lt;/em&gt;Plus magazine, a free quarterly publication that is a joint effort of the Friends and the National Institutes of Health. (NLM provides editorial supervision.) With celebrities such as Lance Armstrong, Mary Tyler Moore and Phylicia Rashad on its cover, &lt;em&gt;NIH Medline&lt;/em&gt;Plus translates the latest research findings from NIH into easy-to-read, informative stories, often with a first-person point of view. Since its creation in 2006, NIH MedlinePlus has seen its circulation rise to one-half a million with a readership of over 5 million. In each issue, Paul Rogers wrote a message inside the front cover, in his capacity as FNLM Chair and a member of the publication&amp;#39;s editorial board. The magazine is distributed to physicians offices, hospitals, clinics, and libraries nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Grant Rogers was born in Ocilia, Georgia on June 4, 1921 and moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida as a child. He graduated from the University of Florida in 1942 and served in the Army during World War II, receiving the Bronze Star Medal for his actions in the European theater. He graduated from the University of Florida&amp;#39;s law school in 1948 and practiced law in Palm Beach until 1955, when he won a special election to fill his late father&amp;#39;s congressional seat. Well-liked and respected, Paul Rogers was reelected 11 times, often without opposition. In his last campaign, he won 91 percent of the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His tireless advocacy for the health and well-being of the public did not slow down in his post-Capitol Hill years. In addition to his FNLM duties, Paul Rogers served as board chairman of ResearchAmerica and the National Osteoporosis Foundation, among other groups, and received the National Academy of Science Public Welfare Medal (1982) and the Albert Lasker Award for Public Service (1993). Appropriately, ResearchAmerica established the Paul G. Rogers Society for Global Health Research to combat diseases that disproportionately affect the world&amp;#39;s poorest nations. An attorney, he also started the health law practice at Hogan &amp;#38; Hartson, a Washington, DC firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visitors to the NIH campus in Bethesda have a lasting reminder of Paul Rogers&amp;#39; many contributions: In 2000, Congress designated the main plaza, in front of Building 1, the Paul G. Rogers Plaza. There, a marker bears his widely quoted statement, &amp;#34;Without research, there is no hope.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rogers&amp;#39; survivors include his wife of 46 years, Rebecca Rogers of Washington, DC; a daughter, Rebecca Laing Sisto of Westfield, NJ; a brother; and four grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.medlineplus.gov"&gt;MedlinePlus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the popular, consumer-friendly health Web site produced by the National Library of Medicine, is celebrating &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/milestones.html"&gt;10 years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of bringing trusted health information to people across the country and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 500 million people in more than 200 countries have turned to MedlinePlus for accurate, up-to-date information since its launch on October 22, 1998. The site, now available in English and Spanish, receives about 12 million visitors each month and is approaching one billion page views a year. MedlinePlus routinely is &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/recognition.html"&gt;recognized&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as one of the best places on the Web to go for health information. It has received numerous mentions in the media, including NBC&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;Today Show,&amp;#34; &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, and it consistently ranks highest among government news sites in the American Customer Satisfaction Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The number of people using MedlinePlus, and the amount of information it contains, has grown exponentially,&amp;#34; says Donald A.B. Lindberg, M.D., Director of the National Library of Medicine. &amp;#34;The Library tries hard to bring health information to the public. MedlinePlus represents our effort to help patients, doctors, and the public to understand health concepts.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What a difference a decade makes. Since its debut in 1998:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;MedlinePlus has grown from 22 health topics to information on more than 770 health topics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Spanish version, &lt;a href="http://medlineplus.gov/spanish/"&gt;MedlinePlus en espaÃ±ol&lt;/a&gt;, was launched in 2002 in response to requests from the public and health care community. It is the most comprehensive Spanish language health site in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A &amp;#34;Go Local&amp;#34; feature was launched in 2003 when MedlinePlus users expressed the desire for help finding health services in their community.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A multiple languages collection with information in more than 40 languages and English translations was launched in 2008. It was created to help the millions of people in the United States with limited English, as well as the health care professionals they visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the health topics, MedlinePlus provides information on drugs and supplements, the latest news, a medical dictionary, an extensive encyclopedia, surgery videos, interactive educational material, and links to other helpful sites to locate clinical trials, understand genetic conditions, and find information specifically for older Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health information on MedlinePlus is professionally selected from reliable sources including the National Institutes of Health, government organizations, medical associations, and more than one thousand other health organizations such as the Mayo Clinic and the Harvard School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Located in Bethesda, Md., the National Library of Medicine is the world&amp;#39;s largest library of the health sciences.

The APHA exhibitor advisory council judged the booths and awarded more than a dozen ribbons based on creativity, originality, color, design, and use of space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2008, the National Library of Medicine opened a 4000-square foot exhibition &amp;#34;Against the Odds: Making a Difference in Global Health,&amp;#34; which tells the stories of people and programs around the world that have made a difference in public health. The onsite exhibition is open to the public free of charge and can be seen at the library in Bethesda, MD into 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traveling version of &amp;#34;Against the Odds,&amp;#34; which debuted at APHA, consists of a series of six-foot-tall banners that highlight stories of individuals and communities making a difference in global health. The traveling exhibition is available for loan to schools of public health, libraries, universities, and community organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schools of public health that would like to host the traveling exhibition can contact the &lt;a href="http://www.asph.org/index.cfm"&gt;Association of Schools of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;A National Library of Medicine (NLM) project to help people find and evaluate nursing homes won a Distinguished Paper Award at the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) 2008 symposium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year in the United States, millions of people choose a nursing home because they or a loved one are too sick to live on their own, or need short-term help after an operation or illness. Recognizing that the search for a good nursing home can be lengthy, or may have to be done at a stressful time, NLM is developing an easy-to-use Web site to help people quickly locate nursing homes and screen them for quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nursing Home Screener, currently in prototype form, uses Web 2.0 technology to display multiple nursing homes on a Google map so it is easier to use. A list of homes is also provided, as an option. The screener enables people to survey nursing home quality in four categories: staffing, fire safety deficiencies, healthcare deficiencies, and quality of care inferred from residents&amp;#39; health. The quality measures come from the publicly-available information that federally-funded nursing homes must provide to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The whole point of the screener is to help someone identify nursing homes that are most worth further investigation or a personal visit,&amp;#34; says George Thoma, PhD, Chief of the Communications Engineering Branch in NLM&amp;#39;s Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications. Thoma co-authored the paper with principal author Glenn Pearson, PhD, and Michael Gill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM team says it is developing the screener for older Americans who may be looking for a home for themselves or spouse, for middle-aged caregivers, and for health care professionals such as social workers, nurses and physicians who may be involved in the search for a nursing home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

People can search for resources by location, by the type of facility or service, or by a specific disease or condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Librarians from Dykes Library at the University of Kansas Medical Center, the State Library of Kansas, public libraries, and the Kansas Regents libraries contributed to the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go Local is an initiative of the National Library of Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health. With today&amp;#39;s launch of Go Local Kansas, and the launch of Go Local Montana earlier this month, there are now more than 30 Go Local (link to http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/golocal/index.html) sites, reaching over 40% of the U.S. population.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In celebration of Black History Month, the National Library of Medicine is pleased to announce an important addition to PubMed Central (PMC), its free digital archive of full-text journal articles: the complete archive of the Journal of the National Medical Association (JNMA), which observes its centennial this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Medical Association (NMA), established in 1895, is the largest and oldest national organization representing African American physicians and allied health professionals in the United States. The JNMA was published quarterly from 1909 to 1938, bimonthly from 1940 to 1977, and monthly since 1978. The archive currently represents over 77,000 digitized pages of issues, cover to cover, through 2007. Current content will be coming at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its founding, this landmark journal has enabled African American health professionals to keep current regarding the latest medical and public health practices, even in the face of segregation and discrimination. This archive provides historical insight into the social, medical and public health issues that continue to be of particular concern to African American patients and physicians. It has also served as a venue to challenge disparaging interpretations of African American health history published in other medical and social science journals. The collection is of great interest to U.S. and international researchers concerned with the societal impact of health care inequalities. Scholars seeking to understand the historic barriers faced by the African American patient and physician will find this collection to be an invaluable resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about PubMed Central, or to browse its contents, go to: &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/"&gt;http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;To celebrate African American History Month, 2009, the National Library of Medicine will open &amp;#34;Nelson Mandela: Man of the People,&amp;#34; an extraordinary photographic tribute to the life and work of South Africa&amp;#39;s first democratically elected President. The exhibition features the work of the critically acclaimed photographer, Dr. Peter Magubane, and is on loan from the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The public is invited to the exhibition opening, sponsored by the NLM Diversity Council and the NLM Office of the Director, in the Lister Hill Center lobby on Thursday, February 5th at 2:00 p.m. The featured speaker will be Mr. Tebogo Kola, First Secretary of Public Diplomacy, Embassy of the Republic of South Africa. Light refreshments will be served.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Magubane&amp;#39;s photography chronicles the career of Nelson Mandela and the turbulent times in which he lived. Beginning in the mid 1950s, when Mandela was a member of the ANC Youth League, the exhibit features over 100 photographs and extends through the death of his son Makgatho in 2005. Mandela was a passionate leader of the anti-apartheid movement. For years, from 1948-1990, South Africa was torn apart by apartheid, or separateness, a legally enforced policy of racial segregation. The exhibition captures Mandela at the heart of this struggle for equality, portraying him as a political activist, prisoner, family man, Nobel laureate, President, and statesman. Highlights include photographs from Mandela&amp;#39;s anti-apartheid defiance campaign and treason trials, graphic images of uprisings and activism, the iconic Time magazine spread of Mandela as a free man, pictures with President George Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush, and Mandela casting his historic vote in South Africa&amp;#39;s first democratic elections on April 27, 1994 in Inanda, Kwazulu Natal. The exhibition is an extraordinary tribute to the life and times of one of the 20th century&amp;#39;s most historic freedom fighters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, a research unit of the New York Public Library, is the largest repository for cultural items commemorating the African-American experience in the U.S. It also serves as a cultural center, hosting performances, programs, and public forums for the study and interpretation of African-American history and culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The exhibition is on display the month of February in the lobby of the Library&amp;#39;s Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications (Building 38A on the campus of the National Institutes of Health).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note to teachers and administrators:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To arrange for a tour of the exhibition, please call Mr. David Nash, National Library of Medicine. 301-496-1046.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

Fifty years later, on November 22, 1859, Darwin&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt;, one of the most influential scientific books ever written, went on sale to the public. Radical in sweep, Darwin&amp;#39;s theory of naturally innovating and endlessly changing webs of life laid bare the deep connections within the living world. Darwin rewrote the book of nature and forced us to rethink humankind&amp;#39;s own place within it. One hundred and 50 years later, we still struggle to comprehend the world that Darwin made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right" alt="Title page of Origin of Species" border="0" height="200" src="/news/DarwinOriginSpecies_1859_tp.jpg" width="250" /&gt; To mark the 200th anniversary of Darwin&amp;#39;s birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of his groundbreaking work, the National Library of Medicine, in collaboration with the Office of NIH History, presents a small exhibition, &amp;#34;Rewriting the Book of Nature: Charles Darwin &amp;#38; the Rise of Evolutionary Theory.&amp;#34; The public is invited to this thought-provoking display, which includes a rare first edition of &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; and other important books by Darwin, Darwin photos and letters, and works by the great naturalist&amp;#39;s predecessors, contemporaries and successors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The exhibition, inside and outside the NLM History of Medicine Division Reading Room, Building 38, first floor, runs from February 9, 2009 to January 15, 2010.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Victor A. McKusick, MD" border="2" height="320" hspace="8" src="/news/mckusick.jpg" vspace="8" width="281" /&gt; The National Library of Medicine announces the release of an extensive selection from the papers of physician Victor A. McKusick (1921-2008), who received the 1997 Lasker Special Achievement Award for his lifelong work in medical genetics, on the Library&amp;#39;s Profiles in ScienceÂ® Web site. The Victor McKusick project is a collaboration with the Alan Mason Chesney Medical Archives of The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, the repository of his papers. With this addition, the number of prominent researchers, public health officials, and promoters of medical research whose personal and professional records are presented on Profiles has grown to twenty-eight. The site is available at &lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Dr. McKusick was the driving force that moved genetics into mainstream academic and clinical medicine; he established training and research programs, fostered gene mapping projects, and created the monumental reference resource, &lt;em&gt;Mendelian Inheritance in Man&lt;/em&gt;. He truly was the founding father of medical genetics&amp;#34; said Donald A. B. Lindberg, M.D., director of the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born and raised in rural Maine, McKusick became interested in medicine during a long hospitalization at the age of 15. He attended Tufts University, but left several credits short of graduation to enter The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine under a special accelerated wartime training program. He received his MD in 1946, and remained at Johns Hopkins for the rest of his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKusick took his first step into medical genetics in 1947 during his internship, when a teenager with intestinal polyps and curious pigmented spots on his lips became his patient. Several years later, he and Dr. Harold Jeghers of Boston published a paper identifying this case and similar ones as an inherited syndrome, probably caused by a single mutant gene. Unable to train as a medical geneticist-the specialty didn&amp;#39;t exist at the time--McKusick went on to train as a cardiologist. For many years he performed innovative studies of heart sounds and murmurs using sound spectrography, and wrote a comprehensive treatise on cardiovascular sound. He remained intrigued with the genetic aspects of disease, however, and carried out a comprehensive study of Marfan syndrome (a genetic disease that often includes heart defects) and four similar disorders, collecting patients and family histories from his own practice and from many other clinical departments at Johns Hopkins. This work produced his first book, &lt;em&gt;Heritable Disorders of Connective Tissue&lt;/em&gt;, first published in 1956.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1957, McKusick established a medical genetics clinic and training program at Johns Hopkins, where he and his colleagues continued to search for, map, and identify genes responsible for thousands of inherited diseases. McKusick&amp;#39;s work showed that understanding the genetics of such diseases could generate new ways to classify, diagnose, and treat them. The Johns Hopkins program alumni went on to establish new medical genetics departments worldwide. In 1960, McKusick organized the first Bar Harbor short course in medical genetics; held annually, the two-week course has since trained over 4,000 clinicians and educators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in the late 1950s, McKusick and his colleagues collected inherited disease cases from the medical literature, the Johns Hopkins clinics, and field studies with the Amish and other groups. In 1966, McKusick published the first edition of his classic reference work &lt;em&gt;Mendelian Inheritance in Man&lt;/em&gt;, a continually updated, annotated catalog of inherited disease genes (now available as the &lt;em&gt;Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man&lt;/em&gt; (OMIM) through the National Library of Medicine.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1969, McKusick was one of the first to propose mapping the entire human genome, and from 1973 to 1991 he helped organize a series of international Human Gene Mapping Workshops. Advances in gene mapping and in molecular biology made large sequencing projects practical by 1986, and McKusick played a leading role on the National Research Council committee charged with assessing the feasibility of what became the Human Genome Project. In 1988, he became founding president of the Human Genome Organization (HUGO), an international coordinating agency for the global mapping and sequencing efforts, and later served on the ethics committees for the Human Genome Project and HUGO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profiles in Science features correspondence, published articles, notebook excerpts, report drafts, and photographs from the Victor McKusick Papers at the Alan Mason Chesney Medical Archives of The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. Visitors to the site can view, for example, excerpts from McKusick&amp;#39;s medical school notebooks, reports and correspondence relating to the establishment of HUGO, correspondence relating to the early years of the Bar Harbor course, and letters between McKusick and Walter Bodmer, Renato Dulbecco, James Watson, Nancy Wexler, and others involved in gene mapping and the Human Genome Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Located in Bethesda, Maryland, the National Library of Medicine is the world&amp;#39;s largest library of the health sciences.

Your library can help by donating print volumes that you no longer wish to retain. If you are a DOCLINE library, use the new Web-based system at &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/journaldonation/"&gt;www.nlm.nih.gov/journaldonation/&lt;/a&gt; to find out what NLM needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system is easy to use. All you need is a list of the titles and volumes you are planning to discard. You can search by title words or phrases or by ISSN. The system searches your DOCLINE holdings so titles are retrieved quickly. If NLM does not need any volumes of a title, the system notifies you immediately. If NLM needs volumes, the system displays a list of them, and you just click on the volumes you will donate. For some titles, the system cannot do an automatic check on what volumes are needed. In these cases, the system will ask you to enter the volumes you can donate, and NLM will send you an e-mail when we determine which volumes we need. You submit your offer electronically from the system. You can print your offer or save it to an Excel file. NLM will send an e-mail to confirm receipt of your offer and to provide instructions on how to have NLM pay for shipping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are not a DOCLINE library, please contact us at 301-496-0081 or at &lt;a href="mailto:NLMJournalDonation@mail.nih.gov"&gt;NLMJournalDonation@mail.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt; to make donations. NLM appreciates your help with this important program.&lt;/p&gt; ###

    <body>&lt;p&gt;NIH will hold a public meeting on Monday, April 20, 2009 from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. to gather input from interested parties on current issues in the development of regulations to expand clinical trial registration and results reporting through NLM&amp;#39;s ClinicalTrials.gov system. The expansion of clinical trial registration and results reporting was mandated by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments of 2007. The public meeting will be held on the NIH Campus in Masur Auditorium. Those who cannot attend the meeting may view the proceedings via NIH webcast &lt;a href="http://videocast.nih.gov"&gt;http://videocast.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt; . NIH has also opened a public docket for written comments on topics to be addressed at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information about the meeting and the request for public comment can be found in the Federal Register notice and at &lt;a href="http://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/public-meeting-april09.html"&gt;http://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/public-meeting-april09.html&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/E9-6198.htm"&gt;MarchÂ 23,Â 2009Â FederalÂ RegisterÂ Notice&lt;/a&gt; for full details (&lt;a href="http://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/Clinical_Trials_FRN31609_POST.pdf"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/collections/archives/ammp/index.html"&gt;Archives and Modern Manuscripts Program&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/"&gt;History of Medicine Division&lt;/a&gt;, National Library of Medicine is pleased to announce the release of a new digital archive of court case summaries published as the Food and Drugs Act Notices of Judgment (&lt;a href="http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/fdanj/"&gt;http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/fdanj/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collection is a digital archive of the notices judgment for products seized under authority of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act and the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The NJs are resources in themselves, but also lead users to the over 2,000 linear foot collection of the evidence files used to prosecute each case. These files include materials such as correspondence, lab results, photographs, and product samples and labeling. This collection offers insight into U.S. legal and governmental history, as well as the evolution of clinical trial science and the social impact of medicine on health. The legal history of some of our best-known consumer items of today, such as Coca Cola, and companies like Merck Pharmaceuticals, can be traced in the collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can perform full-text searching and browse the archive by Case Title, Defendant Name, Adjudicating Court Name, Geographic Seizure Location, and Case Publication Date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To preserve these NJs and make them accessible, we have created a digital archive of both page images and metadata for each NJ. The archive was developed as a joint research project between HMD and the &lt;a href="http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;Lister Hill Center&amp;#39;s Communications Engineering Branch&lt;/a&gt; (CEB). CEB&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/sper.php"&gt;System for Preservation of Electronic Resources&lt;/a&gt; (SPER) is a set of Java-based applications currently used in conjunction with the &lt;a href="http://www.dspace.org/"&gt;DSpace&lt;/a&gt; platform. Among other archiving and preservation functions, SPER performs automated metadata extraction (AME) from TIFF page images, quality control review, and batch ingest of objects in an integrated fashion. SPER leverages the powerful archiving infrastructure and access mechanisms provided by DSpace for storage and dissemination, but the operations are modularized so that they can be used as standalone services or integrated with other repository or digital archive platforms or web services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current content consists of over 6,800 cases (over 4,300 pages) covering actions against Drugs and Devices from 1940-1963. As we complete work on other portions of the collection they will be released on an ongoing basis. Users are welcome to visit the library to use the hard copies at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future releases:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foods and Drugs, 1908-1943 (31,000 cases/21,000 pages)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foods, 1940-1966 (30,000 cases/9,800 pages)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cosmetics, 1940-1964 (256 cases)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, please contact John P.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has learned that some stolen vials of the long-acting insulin Levemir made by Novo Nordisk Inc. have reappeared and are being sold in the U.S. market. Three lots or a total of 129,000 vials of this product were stolen in all. These stolen insulin vials may not have been stored and handled properly and may be dangerous for patients to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA has received one report of a patient who suffered an adverse event due to poor control of glucose levels after using a vial from one of these three lots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency is advising patients who use Levemir insulin to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check your personal supply of insulin to determine if you have Levemir insulin from one of the following lots: XZF0036, XZF0037, and XZF0038. Patients can locate the lot number on the side of the box of insulin and also on the side of the vial.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not use your Levemir insulin if it is from one of these lots. Replace it with a vial of Levemir insulin from another lot. If you must switch to another brand of insulin for any reason, first contact your healthcare provider as another insulin product may require adjustments in dosing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always visually inspect your insulin before using it. Levemir is a clear and colorless solution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact the Novo Nordisk Customer Care Center at 800.727.6500 for what to do with vials from these lots or if you have any other questions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George Strait, Assistant Commissioner for Public Affairs U.S. Food and Drug Administration 301.796.4829&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine is pleased to announce the 2009-2010 year of the leadership program jointly sponsored with the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries (AAHSL). The NLM/AAHSL Leadership Fellows Program is focused on preparing emerging leaders for the position of library director in academic health sciences libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The partnership with NLM has demonstrated its value in encouraging and preparing the next generation of leaders of our libraries,&amp;#34; said AAHSL president Julia Sollenberger. &amp;#34;Its merit is recognized by institutions across the country as they recruit for director positions.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellows will have the opportunity to develop their knowledge and skills in a variety of learning settings, including exposure to leadership in another environment. They will be paired with mentors who are academic health sciences library directors. In addition to the individual relationship with their mentors, fellows benefit from working collaboratively with other fellows and mentors. Experienced program faculty and mentors will provide content and facilitation for the cohort. The program takes advantage of flexible scheduling and an online learning community to minimize disruption to professional and personal schedules. The sponsors will provide financial support for up to five fellows and will underwrite travel and meeting expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-five fellows have participated in the program since its inauguration in 2002. To date, thirteen fellows have assumed director positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The program was key in securing my job as director and continues to sustain me,&amp;#34; noted Neville Prendergast, fellow, class of 2007-2008, and director at Tulane University. &amp;#34;It provided the learning environment to interact with my mentor and other leading directors very willing to share their ideas and experience. It places you in the position of &amp;#39;thinking like a director.&amp;#39;&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Shaffer&lt;/strong&gt;, fellow, class of 2006-2007, and university librarian at Oregon Health &amp;#38; Science University, said, &amp;#34;My mentor &amp;#39;opened the books&amp;#39; to me and taught me about budgets of public and private universities. As a new director, I often turn to the other fellows in my cohort for advice and community, and I can get support from all the mentors who have participated in the program.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gary Freiburger&lt;/strong&gt;, mentor, class of 2008-2009, and director at University of Arizona, stated, &amp;#34;My fellow&amp;#39;s visit to our library gave me a chance to see our operations through fresh eyes. As a mentor, I not only have the chance to rethink my assumptions, I also have the benefit of working with a cohort of directors who share information and experiences.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Program Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one-year program design is multi-faceted: three in-person leadership institutes; attendance at an Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) annual meeting; a yearlong fellow/mentor relationship; Web-based courses and discussions on issues related to library leadership; and a two-week site visit to the mentor&amp;#39;s home library (in one or two-week segments).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program is designed to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduce fellows to leadership theory and practical tools for implementing change at organizational and professional levels;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduce fellows to critical issues facing academic health sciences libraries;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop meaningful professional relationships between fellows and mentors that give fellows access to career guidance and support;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expose fellows to another academic health sciences library and its institutional leadership under the guidance of their mentors;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examine career development and provide models of directors to fellows;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a cohort of leaders who will draw upon each other for support throughout their careers;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Promote diversity in the leadership of the profession; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Offer recognition to emerging leaders and enhance the competitive standing of fellows as they pursue director positions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM/AAHSL Leadership Fellows Program is currently accepting applications and nominations for the August 3, 2009, deadline for potential fellows and mentors for the 2009-2010 experience. Candidates for fellow should have a strong interest in pursuing a directorship in academic health sciences libraries, as well as a minimum of five years of department head level or higher responsibility, or equivalent experience, in an academic health sciences library, hospital library, or other library-related setting. Applications from qualified minority candidates are encouraged. Mentors should have at least five years&amp;#39; experience as director of an academic health sciences library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program brochure, including information on program design, schedule, and application process, is available at &lt;a href="http://data.memberclicks.com/site/aahsl/NLM-AAHSL-Leadership-Fellows-Program-2009-2010.pdf"&gt;http://data.memberclicks.com/site/aahsl/NLM-AAHSL-Leadership-Fellows-Program-2009-2010.pdf&lt;/a&gt; For more information about the program, please contact Carolyn Lipscomb, Program Manager, AAHSL Future Leadership Committee, &lt;a href="mailto:carolynlipscomb@cs.com"&gt;carolynlipscomb@cs.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The Honorable David R. Obey, Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Wisconsin and Chair of the House Committee on Appropriations, saluted the National Center for Biotechnology Information&amp;#39;s 20th anniversary with a June 26, 2009 statement in the Congressional Record. NCBI is a research arm of the National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library, located on the campus of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cong. Obey has long been a friend of biomedical research and health care, and was an early supporter of legislation to create the institution that would become NCBI. His Record statement chronicles developments leading up to the birth of NCBI and recounts the institution&amp;#39;s many milestones. He also hails &amp;#34;NCBI&amp;#39;s visionary leader, Dr. David Lipman&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;NLM&amp;#39;s excellent director, Dr. Donald A. B. Lindberg,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;the bright and dedicated staff of the NCBI&amp;#34; for &amp;#34;20 years of outstanding public service to the nation and the world.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Congressman&amp;#39;s full statement can be found at: &lt;a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2009_record&amp;#38;page=E1618&amp;#38;position=all"&gt;http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2009_record&amp;#38;page=E1618&amp;#38;position=all&lt;/a&gt; (*PDF)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*PDF documents require the use of the AdobeÂ® Reader, which can be &lt;a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/"&gt;downloaded&lt;/a&gt; from Adobe&amp;#39;s Web site at no charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;PubMed Central Repository Will Open New Pathway to Canadian Health Research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Accelerating the development of discoveries and innovations and facilitating their adoption through free and open access to research findings - this is the aim of an important new initiative that will provide researchers and knowledge users free access to a vast digital archive of published health research at their desktop and connect them to an emerging international network of digital archives anchored in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the National Research Council&amp;#39;s Canada Institute for Scientific and Technical Information (NRC-CISTI), and the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) have announced a three-way partnership to establish PubMed Central Canada (PMC Canada). PMC Canada will be a national digital repository of peer-reviewed health and life sciences literature, including research resulting from CIHR funding. This searchable Web-based repository will be permanent, stable and freely accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;PMC Canada builds on the successful PubMed Central (PMC) archive developed by the US National Library of Medicine and will join UK PubMed Central (UKPMC) as a member of the broader PMC International network. This network enables national versions of PMC to share content, and will make much of PubMed Central and UKPMC content accessible through PMC Canada. The network uses software developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the division of NLM that created and administers PMC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&amp;#34;We are pleased that Canada is joining the PMC International family, further strengthening this effort to share life sciences literature across the world,&amp;#34; says NLM Director Donald A.B. Lindberg, MD. &amp;#34;International collaboration and data sharing has proven to be a strong driver of scientific advance, with projects such as the GenBank international DNA sequence database propelling new discoveries at a rapid pace. The addition of Canada as a PMCI member should similarly aid the progress of science, while also enhancing public access to the results of research that affects health and health care.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Full release at: http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/39788.html.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

You can view the itinerary at: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/about/exhibition/travelingexhibitions/ctfom.html "&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/about/exhibition/travelingexhibitions/ctfom.html &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Benjamin, who has held leadership positions statewide and nationally, has long provided medical care on the Gulf Coast. In 1990, she founded Bayou La Batre Rural Health Clinic in the fishing village of Bayou La Batre, Alabama. Her clinic was battered by Hurricane Georges in 1998 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, but Benjamin rebuilt it each time and continued to offer medical care to the village&amp;#39;s 2,500 residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of her family practice patients are uninsured, according to the MacArthur Foundation, which last year awarded her one of its prestigious $500,000 &amp;#34;genius&amp;#34; grants. Her patient population includes immigrants from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, who comprise a third of Bayou La Batre&amp;#39;s population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benjamin received a bachelor&amp;#39;s degree in 1979 from Xavier University of Louisiana, attended Morehouse School of Medicine from 1980 to 1982 and received a doctor of medicine degree from the University of Alabama at Birmingham in 1984. She completed her residency in family practice at the Medical Center of Central Georgia in 1987 and has served as CEO of the Bayou La Batre Rural Health Clinic since its founding in 1990. She earned a master&amp;#39;s degree in business administration in 1991 from Tulane University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Benjamin also served as the associate dean for rural health at the University of South Alabama&amp;#39;s College of Medicine and as president of the State of Alabama Medical Association from 2002 to 2003.She is the first woman, first African American woman and first person under age 40 to sit on the board of trustees of the American Medical Association, serving from 1995 through 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Surgeon General serves as America&amp;#39;s chief health educator by providing Americans the best scientific information available on how to improve their health and reduce the risk of illness and injury. In carrying out all responsibilities, the Surgeon General reports to the Assistant Secretary for Health, who is the principal advisor to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on public health and scientific issues. The US Surgeon General also serves on the NLM Board of Regents as an ex officio member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for Nominations:&lt;/strong&gt; As the U.S. Member of the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation (IHTSDO), the National Library of Medicine (NLM) is soliciting nominations of potential candidates for the four IHTSDO Standing Committees Ã¢ÂÂ Content, Quality Assurance, Implementation &amp;#38; Innovation (&lt;em&gt;formerly&lt;/em&gt; Research &amp;#38; Innovation), and Technical. These Committees have important roles in the ongoing development of the SNOMED CT clinical terminology and in the IHTSDO. Nominations are &lt;strong&gt;due to NLM by August 5, 2009&lt;/strong&gt; (see details below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current roster, terms of reference, and recent reports of each Committee are available on the IHTSDO website (http://www.ihtsdo.org/about-ihtsdo/governance-and-advisory/standing-committees/). The Committees are described in Sections 9.4-9.9 of the Articles of the IHTSDO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half of each Standing CommitteeÃ¢ÂÂs 12 members are serving terms that expire in December 2009. People elected to these slots will serve for 2 years (Jan. 2010-Dec. 2011). There may be additional Committee vacancies caused by resignations. People elected to fill these mid-term slots will serve for 1 year (Jan-Dec. 2010). Committee members whose terms are expiring are eligible for re-nomination, but must submit a nomination package. (see details below). As a result of changes to the IHTSDO Articles approved in April 2009, the majority of the positions on each Committee are at-large seats and may be filled by people nominated by IHTSDO Members from any geographic region. The Americas region includes the U.S. and Canada. The Canadian call for nominations is being run on the same schedule as the U.S. process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Nomination Process:&lt;/strong&gt; Beginning this year, all U.S. SNOMED CT Affiliate Licensees (aka, all U.S. UMLS Licensees) may vote to select the U.S. candidates for IHTSDO Committees. The timeline for nominations and elections is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 15, 2009 Ã¢ÂÂ August 5, 2009:&lt;/strong&gt; NLM accepts nominations of potential candidates for the four IHTSDO Standing Committees. Only candidates with complete nomination packets will be accepted (see below for details, as &lt;strong&gt;the IHTSDO has instituted new nomination requirements and forms&lt;/strong&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 10, 2009 Ã¢ÂÂ August 26, 2009:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. SNOMED CT Affiliates cast votes for their top three candidates for each Standing Committee. Instructions for casting ballots will be sent to U.S. SNOMED CT Affiliates on August 10th. For each Committee, the three candidates receiving the highest number of votes will become the U.S. nominees for the Committee.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 1, 2009:&lt;/strong&gt; NLM will submit the names of the three (3) candidates receiving the highest number of votes as nominees for each of the four Committees to the IHTSDO for consideration by the IHTSDO General Assembly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 5, 2009:&lt;/strong&gt; IHTSDO will announce the final results of the election process at the General Assembly Meeting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Committee Obligations and Participation Logistics:&lt;/strong&gt; English is the official language of the IHTSDO, but Committee Members must be willing to take extra steps to ensure understanding by those for whom English is a second language. Teleconference arrangements are available for all Committee meetings, but, given the geographic distribution of IHTSDO members (currently Australia, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Lithuania, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States), meeting schedules cannot be convenient for all relevant time zones. The IHTSDO encourages Committee Members to attend at least one of the two major IHTSDO meetings each year in person. For U.S. Committee members who need assistance to attend face to face meetings, NLM supports travel to at least two IHTSDO meetings per year. Committee Members must participate in at least 50% of their CommitteeÃ¢ÂÂs meetings to retain their seat on the Committee. U.S. Committee members may also be called upon to provide advice and input to NLM on matters related to the IHTSDO and SNOMED CT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submitting your nomination:&lt;/strong&gt; Nominations are &lt;strong&gt;due to NLM by August 5, 2009&lt;/strong&gt;. Please submit your nomination packets to NLM by e-mail (nichsr@nlm.nih.gov) or Fax (301-402-3193) with the subject line Ã¢ÂÂUS Nominations Ã¢ÂÂ IHTSDO Standing CommitteesÃ¢ÂÂ. Each nomination packet must include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Completed &lt;strong&gt;Nomination Form&lt;/strong&gt; (PDF, Word)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 page &lt;strong&gt;mini curriculum vitae&lt;/strong&gt; highlighting the key areas of the applicantÃ¢ÂÂs experience and expertise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 page &lt;strong&gt;statement of interest&lt;/strong&gt; outlining why the nominee is suited &lt;strong&gt;for the particular Committee in question&lt;/strong&gt; and why the nominee feels that the CommitteeÃ¢ÂÂs work is important. &lt;strong&gt;NOTE: Nominations MUST be for a specific Committee&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Completed &lt;strong&gt;skills matrix&lt;/strong&gt; for the relevant Committee summarizing key aspects of the nomineeÃ¢ÂÂs background&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Content (PDF, Word)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quality Assurance (PDF, Word)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implementation and Innovation (PDF, Word)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technical (PDF, Word)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Completed &lt;strong&gt;Declaration of Interests&lt;/strong&gt; (PDF, Word)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals may nominate themselves.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine announces the release of the first version of the CORE (&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;linical &lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;bservations &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;ecording and &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;ncoding) Subset of &lt;a href="https://teamsite.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/snomed_main.html"&gt;SNOMED CTÂ®&lt;/a&gt; (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine--Clinical TermsÂ®). The primary purpose of this Subset is to facilitate the use of SNOMED CT for coding of problem list data in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and to enable more meaningful use of EHRs to improve patient safety, health care quality, and health information exchange. SNOMED CT is owned and maintained by the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation (IHTSDO) and is a designated US standard terminology for diagnosis and problem lists. Use of SNOMED CT is free in IHTSDO Member countries, including the United States, in low income countries, and for approved research projects in any country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CORE Problem List Subset of SNOMED CT was derived based on datasets submitted by seven large scale healthcare institutions. The most frequently used terms (covering 95% of usage volume) from these institutions are mapped to the corresponding SNOMED CT concepts where such concepts exist. The Subset contains about 5,000 SNOMED CT concepts and is described in detail at &lt;a href="/research/umls/Snomed/core_subset.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/core_subset.html&lt;/a&gt;. NLM encourages input on how to improve the Subset to make it more useful to EHR developers, implementers, and users. Please send feedback to &lt;a href="mailto:kwfung@nlm.nih.gov"&gt;Dr. Kin Wah Fung&lt;/a&gt;, Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Subset is available at &lt;a href="http://download.nlm.nih.gov/umls/kss/SNOMEDCT_CORE_SUBSET/SNOMEDCT_CORE_SUBSET_200907.zip"&gt;http://download.nlm.nih.gov/umls/kss/SNOMEDCT_CORE_SUBSET/SNOMEDCT_CORE_SUBSET_200907.zip&lt;/a&gt;.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Adrian Kantrowitz" border="0" height="183" hspace="5" src="/news/kantrowitz.jpg" vspace="5" width="150" /&gt; The National Library of Medicine, a constituent institute of the National Institutes of Health, announces the release of an extensive selection from the papers of surgeon Adrian Kantrowitz (1918-2008) on the Library&amp;#39;s Profiles in ScienceÂ® Web site. Best known for performing the world&amp;#39;s second human heart transplant, Kantrowitz was also a leading surgeon-inventor who developed bioelectronic devices such as cardiac pacemakers, mechanical left heart devices, and the intraaortic balloon pump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this addition, the number of prominent researchers, clinicians, public health officials, and promoters of medical research whose personal and professional records are presented on Profiles has grown to twenty-nine. The site is at &lt;a href="http://www.profiles.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#34;Adrian Kantrowitz was a gifted innovator who repeatedly expanded the boundaries of both cardiac surgery and medical technology. His inventions, especially those providing counterpulsation to the heart, have saved thousands of lives,&amp;#34; said Donald A. B. Lindberg, MD, director of the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kantrowitz (1918-2008) was born in New York City, the son of a physician. He demonstrated an early interest in both medicine and electronic devices. After earning his MD at the Long Island College of Medicine (now SUNY Downstate Medical School) in 1943, he served as a battalion surgeon during World War II. He hoped to specialize in neurosurgery after the war, but when no residencies were available in that field, he pursued training in general and thoracic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgery on the heart had long been limited by the need to maintain blood circulation during the operation, but by the late 1940s, thoracic surgeons had started developing corrective procedures that could be done quickly and without stopping the heart. Concurrently, they searched for ways to artificially slow or maintain the patient&amp;#39;s circulation to extend the duration and scope of their operations. Kantrowitz joined these efforts, adding surgical research to his duties during his surgical residency at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx. He soon developed a left heart bypass device that would allow limited open-heart surgery. Though it was never adopted for human surgery, Kantrowitz filmed an open-heart procedure performed on a dog in 1951, producing the world&amp;#39;s first motion picture of the interior of a beating heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many early cardiac surgeons focused on repairing structural problems such as damaged or defective mitral valves, Kantrowitz sought ways to aid hearts weakened by disease or narrowed coronary arteries. He reasoned that this might be done by providing an extra pulse of blood to the coronary arteries during diastole, the resting phase of the heartbeat, and, during a PHS fellowship in 1951-52, showed that such &amp;#34;diastolic augmentation&amp;#34; (also called &amp;#34;counterpulsation&amp;#34;) was possible. Between 1955 and 1970, as director of cardiovascular surgery at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn, Kantrowitz helped to revolutionize cardiac care, developing implantable pacemakers as well as diastolic augmentation devices, including his first left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and the intraaortic balloon pump, now used to help thousands of cardiac patients each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although committed to finding mechanical support for people in heart failure, Kantrowitz knew that for patients with irreparable defects or damage, a heart transplant might provide another important option. In 1962, he and his team began animal transplant research, building on the work of Stanford surgeons Norman Shumway and Richard Lower. On December 6, 1967, only three days after Christiaan Barnard carried out the world&amp;#39;s first human heart transplant in South Africa, Kantrowitz performed the second one, transplanting the heart of an anencephalic infant to a recipient baby with irreparable heart defects. Although the patient survived only a few hours, the operation was an important milestone in the development of heart transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1970, Kantrowitz left Maimonides to head a new cardiac research unit at the Sinai Hospital of Detroit, where he and his staff perfected the intraaortic balloon pump and developed a second LVAD model. In 1983, he and his wife Jean founded L.VAD Technologies, a bioelectronics development company. Kantrowitz published over 200 articles and obtained more than 20 patents during his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profiles in Science features correspondence, published articles, and photographs from the Adrian Kantrowitz Papers at the National Library of Medicine. Visitors to the site can view, for example, photos of the first human heart transplant done in the United States, Kantrowitz&amp;#39;s correspondence with other physicians about implanting the early pacemaker models, and correspondence with electrical engineers who helped fabricate prototypes of his pacemakers and other cardiac assist devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Located in Bethesda, Maryland, the National Library of Medicine is the world&amp;#39;s largest library of the health sciences.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine announces the introduction of Rapid Research Notes (RRN), a new resource developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a division of NLM, to archive research made available through online venues for rapid scientific communication. The RRN archive (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rrn"&gt;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rrn&lt;/a&gt;) allows users to access research that is provided through participating publisher programs designed for immediate communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating such an archive has been discussed often by NCBI&amp;#39;s public advisors, but the recent outbreak of H1N1 influenza provided an increased impetus for the project. Responding to the call for a means to quickly share research information about H1N1, the Public Library of Science developed PLoS Currents: Influenza (&lt;a href="http://www.ploscurrents.org/influenza"&gt;www.ploscurrents.org/influenza&lt;/a&gt;), an open-access, online resource for immediate communication and discussion of new scientific data, analyses, and ideas in the area of influenza. In order to make research available as soon as possible, submissions are not peer reviewed in depth, but are screened by a group of leading researchers in the field who decide whether a contribution is suitable; those judged suitable are immediately posted to the PLoS Currents: Influenza Web site and archived at RRN with a stable ID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLoS Currents: Influenza is the first collection to be archived in RRN. NCBI expects the RRN archive to expand over time to include additional collections in other high-interest biomedical fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#34;Physician at the Breakfast Table: Oliver Wendell Holmes as Popular Icon&amp;#34;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History of Medicine Division Reading Room&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 17, 2009 to January 11, 2010&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year marks the 200th anniversary of the birth of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. (August 29, 1809 - October 7, 1894), noted physician, lecturer, poet, novelist, and father of the Supreme Court Justice with the same name. Through his wit and turn of phrase, Holmes became an iconic figure in popular American culture, most notably through his book of essays, The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table, first published in 1858. His image and quotations from his works became ubiquitous, and he was one of the most sought after lecturers in America on topics ranging from medicine to literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oliver Wendell Holmes is most known in medicine for his work, The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever (1843), in which he challenged the medical establishment about its treatment of women during childbirth. He was professor of anatomy at Harvard for over 30 years and was an immensely influential figure in American medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Exhibition includes 22 items related to Holmes, including a color lithograph portrait by Leslie Ward (a.k.a. SPY) from Vanity Fair in 1886 (pictured below) and nine colorful editions of Holmes&amp;#39; noted Autocrat. Materials in the Exhibition are from the collections of The National Library of Medicine and Marilyn Barth of Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="bottom" alt="Caricature of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., by Sir Leslie Ward, from Vanity Fair, June 19, 1886." border="0" height="360" src="/news/vanityfair.jpg" width="223" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caricature of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., by Sir Leslie Ward, from Vanity Fair, June 19, 1886.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Lecture, Q and A Sessions with the Curator and a Traveling Version Will Help Spread Word of this Gripping Examination of Women&amp;#39;s Roles and the Relationship between Science and Society&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine yesterday unveiled &amp;#34;&lt;em&gt;The Literature of Prescription: Charlotte Perkins Gilman and The Yellow Wall-Paper&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;#34; a banner exhibition which will be on display in the lobby of the National Library of Medicine (Building 38, first floor) through Saturday, September 26. The Library is open 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM weekdays (except Federal holidays) and 8:30 AM to 2:00 PM Saturdays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibition examines the relationship between science and society. In the late 19th century, when women were challenging traditional ideas about gender that excluded them from political and intellectual life, medical and scientific experts drew on notions of female weakness to justify inequality between the sexes. Artist and writer Charlotte Perkins Gilman, who was discouraged from pursuing a career to preserve her health, rejected these ideas in a terrifying short story titled &amp;#34;The Yellow Wall-Paper.&amp;#34; The famous tale served as an indictment of the medical profession and the social conventions restricting women&amp;#39;s professional and creative opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;This exhibition is opening at a time of renewed interest in Gilman&amp;#39;s life and &amp;#39;The Yellow Wall-Paper,&amp;#39;&amp;#34; observed curator Manon Parry, of NLM&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division. &amp;#34;Her classic tale of the treatment of depression is not only a shocking horror story, but a powerful critique of the medical profession and one of the founding texts of American feminism.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exhibition describes Gilman&amp;#39;s life and career, her experience of depression, the medical advice of Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, and the writing and publication of &amp;#34;The Yellow Wall-Paper.&amp;#34; The six-banner traveling version is accompanied by an online exhibition which includes additional primary source texts, educational resources for high school and undergraduate students, and references for further research. You can visit the exhibition Web site at &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/theliteratureofprescription"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/theliteratureofprescription&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In conjunction with the exhibition&amp;#39;s launch, the History of Medicine Division seminar series will feature a presentation by historian &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/theliteratureofprescription/education/c2HigherEDUaboutModule.html"&gt;Helen Horowitz&lt;/a&gt; , author of a forthcoming book on Gilman and Dr. Mitchell, and developer of the higher education module available on the exhibition Web site, which will launch the week of October 1st. The higher education module is a new element for college professors and students. Using the exhibition as a resource, scholars develop six hours of class materials including supplemental readings, discussion points, and other content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As part of a collaboration with the Schlesinger Library, Cambridge Massachusetts, the exhibition Web site will also feature digitized images and manuscript pages from the papers of Charlotte Perkins Gilman.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Exhibition Program will also be offering special Question and Answer sessions with the exhibition curator, from noon to 1 PM Wednesday, September 9th, and Wednesday, September 23rd. To schedule a tour at another time during the exhibition&amp;#39;s run, please contact Erika Mills, Exhibition Coordinator, at: 301.594.1947 or &lt;a href="mailto:NLMExhibition@mail.nih.gov"&gt;NLMExhibition@mail.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beginning October 4th, two copies of the show will be on display in libraries across America. Please consult the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/about/exhibition/travelingexhibitions/literature.html"&gt;Traveling Exhibitions Web site&lt;/a&gt; for the tour schedule, or to apply to be a host institution. As with all NLM traveling exhibitions, this show is available free of charge with borrowing institutions paying incoming shipping only (about $200-300).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Charlotte Perkins Gilman writing at her desk, ca. 1916-1922." border="1" height="208" src="/news/gilman.jpg" width="283" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charlotte Perkins Gilman writing at her desk, ca. 1916-1922.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtesy Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="Illustration from The Yellow Wall-Paper" border="0" height="313" src="/news/yellowwall.jpg" width="432" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illustration from &amp;#34;The Yellow Wall-Paper,&amp;#34; which shows the narrator with her husband, who has fainted after finding her in deep distress,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The New England Magazine, January 1892.

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Physician and Administrator Played Key Role in the Development of Many NLM Programs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Dr. Harold M. Schoolman" border="0" height="250" hspace="5" src="/news/schoolman.jpg" vspace="5" width="180" /&gt; Harold M. Schoolman, MD, former Deputy Director for Research and Education of the National Library of Medicine, died in August. A fine clinician who had been trained in internal medicine and hematology, he gravitated into health-related administration. He had a distinguished 32-year career with the federal government, first at the Department of Veterans Affairs as Assistant to the Director for Medical Program Development and Evaluation and, in various capacities at the National Library of Medicine from 1970 to 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;As NLM Deputy Director for Research and Education, &amp;#39;Hack&amp;#39; Schoolman was an administrator nonpareil of the Library&amp;#39;s vast and varied research and education activities,&amp;#34; commented NLM Director Dr. Donald A.B. Lindberg. &amp;#34;He clearly understood this institution and its mandate to provide the best and broadest medical information possible to professionals and the public.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ã¢ÂÂDr. Schoolman was a valued friend and colleague who effectively advanced the programs and mission of the Library,Ã¢ÂÂ said former NLM Deputy Director Kent A. Smith. Ã¢ÂÂHe also did an outstanding job while serving as Acting Director of the National Library of Medicine in 1983 and 1984. During that transition period, Hack demonstrated his leadership in managing the institution and bolstering the morale of the staff.Ã¢ÂÂ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;He may not have relished the role,&amp;#34; said current NLM Deputy Director Betsy L. Humphreys, &amp;#34;but Hack became the &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; expert on many thorny policy issues facing the National Library of Medicine, including copyright as applied to health information, the licensing of NLM&amp;#39;s databases, and federal regulation of medical software. Throughout the controversies and debates, he was admired as a thoughtful and articulate champion of the Library&amp;#39;s position.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A May 4, 1999 resolution from the NLM Board of Regents, its principal advisory body, saluted Dr. Schoolman on his retirement for, among other achievements, playing &amp;#34;a key role in the development of important NLM programs including the National Network of Libraries of Medicine, the acquisition and organization of non-print educational media, internal NLM research on information retrieval, and the Unified Medical Language System.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Schoolman was honored as &amp;#34;Alumnus of the Year for Service to the Government&amp;#34; from the University of Illinois, received numerous federal commendations, including the NLM and NIH Directors&amp;#39; Awards and the Superior Service Honor Award from the Department of Health and Human Services, and was an elected member of the American College of Medical Informatics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Hack, so called throughout his adult life because he drove a taxi as a student, brought high intelligence, imperturbable good humor and a never-flagging sense of decency to all he undertook and all he said,&amp;#34; observed current NLM Deputy Director for Research and Education Dr. Milton Corn, a longtime friend and colleague. &amp;#34;His passions included art, good food, and social justice. Harold Schoolman&amp;#39;s legion of friends will long treasure his memory.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Standardization Will Support Quality Health Care for Children&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) yesterday launched the Newborn Screening Coding and Terminology Guide (&lt;a href="http://newbornscreeningcodes.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://newbornscreeningcodes.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;), an important step toward efficient electronic exchange of standard newborn screening data. The new Web site was created in collaboration with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, all components of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as a number of professional organizations, to enable more effective use of newborn screening test results in assessing child health and improving lifelong health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newborn screening is an important part of public health, but use of test results is complicated by wide variations among states in the ways tests are conducted and results recorded - and by inefficient, paper-based communications. The current situation can delay rapid attention to a child&amp;#39;s health problems, and it creates frustration and extra work for parents, health care providers, and public health authorities. The new Web site is a &amp;#34;translator,&amp;#34; to help deal with current complexity and to promote more efficient electronic exchange of newborn screening information in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Web site is designed to help states move toward the use of common terminology and coding standards, a key step in enabling electronic exchange of laboratory test information as well as readying newborn screening information for inclusion in electronic health records (EHRs). The site covers more than 100 conditions and lists the terminologies and codes used for each. It also identifies the tests that may be used in screening for each condition. For all the conditions and tests included, the preferred standard terminology and codes are indicated. Users of the Web site can view the information interactively or download electronic datasets of standard names and identifiers for use in their systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The Web site can also help researchers untangle the confusion of terms and tests that exist today,&amp;#34; said Dr. Clem McDonald, director of NLM&amp;#39;s Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications. &amp;#34;But beyond research, the most important goal for the new Web site is to help bring about efficient electronic exchange of newborn screening information. The big gain for patients and providers will come when we can include this information in a child&amp;#39;s permanent EHR.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of the Newborn Screening Codes and Terminology Guide is to provide a standard framework for reporting the results of newborn screening tests whose contents can be accurately interpreted by recipient electronic systems for use in care, follow-up and analysis. This standard framework will also enable the use and comparison of data from different laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;For decades, the NLM has been a trailblazer in conducting and supporting research in clinical informatics and electronic medical records,&amp;#34; said NLM Director Dr. Donald A.B. Lindberg. &amp;#34;Harmonizing standard coding, terminology and electronic messaging methods in newborn screening will support quality health care for children. Moreover, public health agencies will be better equipped to observe and compare nationwide trends from newborn screening test results, which will also support efforts of the biomedical research community at NIH and elsewhere to improve newborn screening methods and evaluation.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Library Has Partnered with NHANES for Past 20 Years&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine paid tribute to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) on the occasion of its 50th anniversary, September 29, 2009, acknowledging the program&amp;#39;s many contributions to improving the health of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NHANES began in 1959 as the National Health Examination Survey. Since then, the program, under the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), a division of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has been a primary source of data on the nation&amp;#39;s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NHANES data come from household interviews and standardized examinations and laboratory testing of a sample of the nation&amp;#39;s civilian, non-institutionalized population. NHANES has expanded since the survey&amp;#39;s inception to include a nutritional component now conducted in collaboration with the US Department of Agriculture, and measures of environmental exposure with the National Center for Environmental Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on NHANES survey results, scientists were able to detect abnormally high levels of lead in blood, which they traced to leaded gasoline. Those findings led to efforts to ban leaded gasoline and, as a result, lead levels in blood dropped dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NHANES also documented America&amp;#39;s growing rates of obesity through direct physical measurements. And its scientific documentation of low levels of folic acid, a B vitamin, among women of child-bearing age, influenced the policy decision to fortify the food supply with folic acid, to reduce the number of infants born with neural tube defects, anencephaly and spina bifida. Rates of these serious birth defects have greatly decreased because women now get more adequate amounts of folate through foods in the crucial month following conception, a period before many women start taking prenatal vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hallmark of NHANES is its partnerships with other CDC programs and the National Institutes of Health, among other government agencies. Among other NHANES-NIH collaborations, NLM has played a role in the last 20 years of the survey by taking on some of the digital tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in collaboration with the NCHS in the early 1990&amp;#39;s, NLM&amp;#39;s Lister Hill Center acquired text and x-ray films collected in the NHANES II and III surveys. The 17,000 films, of cervical and lumbar spine x-rays, were initially digitized for preservation, but found application in several research domains. These digital images and about 2,000 fields of alphanumeric data for each of several thousand survey subjects are made available to the public through the WebMIRS system used by researchers in epidemiology and other areas in biomedicine (&lt;a href="http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/webmirs/"&gt;http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/webmirs/&lt;/a&gt; ). In addition, the data has been used to develop a digital atlas to serve as a reference tool for the interpretation of cervical and lumbar spine x-rays. The atlas contains representative images for several grades of severity for a number of spinal conditions on which expert rheumatologist readers have reached agreement in grading. Details may be found at &lt;a href="http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/atlas/index.php"&gt;http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/atlas/index.php&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parts of the NHANES collection is provided by the Lister Hill Center as validated reference (&amp;#34;truth&amp;#34;) data for research in several areas of interest to the computer vision and image engineering communities, including: automated indexing by shape, texture and other image features; querying image databases by image example or sketch; advanced image compression algorithms; and classification of images according to the presence/absence of osteoarthritis features, such as disc space narrowing and subluxation (misalignment of the spine). Publications in these areas appear in &lt;a href="http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Commemorates 150th Anniversary of Publication of On the Origin of Species (1859)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; Lister Hill Auditorium, National Library of Medicine (NIH)&lt;br /&gt;8600 Rockville Pike, Bldg. 38A&lt;br /&gt;Bethesda, MD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt; Thursday, October 1, 2009&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 9:00 AM - 6:15 PM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Agenda appears below&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Program is free and open to the public. All are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On October 1, 1859, Charles Darwin wrote in his diary, &amp;#34;finished proofs.&amp;#34; The proofs he referred to were those of &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt;, a landmark in the history of science. It appeared in print the following month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darwin may have finished the page proofs, but the process of persuading scientists and the public about evolution had just begun. Darwin pieced together evidence for his theory of natural selection from many sources, including studies of domestic breeding, anatomical similarities among species (&amp;#34;homology&amp;#34;), embryology, the sequential order of fossils, and the presence of vestigial organs. Bur whether this evidence ever constituted &amp;#34;proof&amp;#34; of evolution was questioned at the time and remains unsettled today, in part because of broader cultural and religious concerns about evolution. The &amp;#34;proofs&amp;#34; were far from finished in 1859.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This symposium brings together a line-up of internationally-renowned scholars, representing a cross section of disciplines, who will discuss historical, philosophical and scientific perspectives on Darwin and evolution. It has two general aims. First, it seeks to trace the different ways in which evolution has been understood in this period, and how these ways of understanding related to the changing basis of scientific evidence on evolution. Second, it seeks to explain why scientific &amp;#34;proofs&amp;#34; of Darwinian evolution have been unpersuasive to many individuals, including those who promote creationism and intelligent design. The speakers&amp;#39; perspectives on evolution have raised important questions about the nature of the evidence in favor of evolution, and the relationship between proof and belief. Put another way, a focus on Darwin&amp;#39;s critics and supporters can illuminate the many ways in which &amp;#34;proof&amp;#34; has been understood in the last 150 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPEAKERS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcoming remarks by NLM Director Donald A.B.

Dr. Kirschstein was an outstanding scientist, mentor and health administrator. In 1974, she became the first woman to direct an NIH institute, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, a post she held until 1993. Kirschstein served as NIH deputy director under Harold Varmus and twice served as acting director of NIH in 1993 and again in 2000-2002, holding the post for 29 months until Elias Zerhouni took over. &amp;#34;She knew everything, everybody, every rule and was an incredible resource,&amp;#34; said Dr. Varmus in the October 16, 2009 issue of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always keenly interested in involving more women in biomedical research, she became director of the newly established NIH Office of Research on Women&amp;#39;s Health in 1990. Dr. Kirschstein was also a crusader for greater training of minority scientists and health professionals, and for involving greater numbers of minority populations in research studies. Despite recent poor health, Dr. Kirschstein was still working until the week before her death, NIH Director Francis Collins said in an e-mail to staff. &amp;#34;The world has lost one of its dearest, most dedicated public servants, one with a huge heart and brilliant mind,&amp;#34; Dr. Collins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_185.html"&gt;detailed biography of Dr. Kirschstein&lt;/a&gt; appears on the Web site of the NLM exhibition, Changing the Face of Medicine, profiling America&amp;#39;s outstanding female physicians, past and present.

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Governor Proclaims October 28, 2009 &amp;#34;Go Local&amp;#34; Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;People across Louisiana now have a free, fast, and easy way to find health care services in their community. A new Web site called Louisiana Go Local lists thousands of services across the state. People can find doctors, hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, support groups, diabetes care, cancer services, home health care, weight management services, and much more by visiting Louisiana Go Local (www.medlineplus.gov/lagolocal.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gov. Bobby Jindal proclaimed October 28, 2009 Go Local Day in Louisiana to recognize the launch of the site. The &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/go_local.pdf"&gt;proclamation&lt;/a&gt; [PDF] notes that &amp;#34;knowing how to locate health services in the community can aid in the prevention of disease and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louisiana Go Local is produced by Baton Rouge GeneralÃ¢ÂÂs Health Sciences Library in collaboration with the LSU School of Library and Information Science, and the National Library of Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Louisiana Go Local provides health resources that will help empower our citizens to make more informed decisions for themselves as well as their families,&amp;#34; says Melissa Fahrmann, manager of Baton Rouge GeneralÃ¢ÂÂs Health Sciences Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Web site is simple to use. You can search for health care services by parish, by the type of service needed, or by a particular health topic. The site offers additional information and convenience because it is connected to MedlinePlus.gov, the consumer health Web site of the National Library of Medicine. For example, if someone searching for diabetes care on Louisiana Go Local wants to learn more about the disease, they can click on &amp;#34;Health Information&amp;#34; and be taken to MedlinePlus. Or, someone reading about diabetes on MedlinePlus can link to Louisiana Go Local to find diabetes care, support groups, and other services in their community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There currently are more than 2,000 resources listed in Louisiana Go Local. Cancer Services of Greater Baton Rouge is one of those resources. The organization&amp;#39;s librarian, Katy Stowe Bordelon, sees the benefit of being listed. &amp;#34;Life is a whirlwind for newly diagnosed cancer patients,&amp;#34; she says. &amp;#34;Louisiana Go Local will be an excellent resource for anyone with cancer, their families, friends or caregivers to consult to quickly find oncologists, treatment facilities, support groups, and community agencies that will help make their journeys a little less trying.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine created Go Local to make its MedlinePlus Web site an even more valuable resource. Go Local sites are established in states or regions through partnerships with libraries. The National Library of Medicine makes available the Go Local computer technology while the partner libraries create and maintain the sites. Go local debuted in 2003 in North Carolina. With the addition of Louisiana, there are now 34 Go Local sites in 31 states, serving 46% of the US population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Go Local team offers special thanks for contributions made by the Louisiana Go Local Advisory Board, East Baton Rouge Parish Library, and Pennington Library and Information Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** Links to download a copy of the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/lagolocal_brochure.pdf"&gt;Louisiana Go Local brochure&lt;/a&gt; [PDF] (&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/lagolocal_brochure.html"&gt;Louisiana Go Local brochure html version&lt;/a&gt;) and Louisiana &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/lagolocal_bookmark.pdf"&gt;Go Local bookmark&lt;/a&gt; [PDF] (&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/lagolocal_bookmark.html"&gt;Go Local bookmark html version&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h4&gt;Map Available NowÃ¢ÂÂNLM Seeks Users to Test, Evaluate&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) has released a draft rules-based mapping from SNOMED Clinical TermsÃÂ® (SNOMED CTÃÂ®) to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). The map was designed to support semi-automated administrative reporting and reimbursement for healthcare services within U.S. healthcare organizations. The NLM seeks users to Ã¢ÂÂtest driveÃ¢ÂÂ and provide feedback for the mapÃ¢ÂÂwhich will guide the development of related maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The draft map consists of approximately 5,000 mappings representing the SNOMED CT terms most commonly used by Kaiser Permanente and the University of Nebraska. It is designed to support administrative reporting and reimbursement processes originating with data sets where SNOMED CT is the core terminology for clinical descriptive purposes. It provides a validated concept-based mapping to ICD-9-CM, recognizing that in some selected cases, further processing of ICD-9-CM codes may be required for specialized business applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can evaluate and test the map now by downloading it from the NLM Web site at &lt;a href="/research/umls/mapping_projects/snomedct_to_icd9cm_reimburse.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/mapping_projects/snomedct_to_icd9cm_reimburse.html&lt;/a&gt;. Starting December 1, 2009, through February 1, 2010, users will be able to provide feedback to the NLM and CAP STS. More details about the feedback process will be posted on the &lt;a href="/research/umls/mapping_projects/snomedct_to_icd9cm_reimburse.html"&gt;same Web page&lt;/a&gt; by December 1, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ã¢ÂÂWe strongly encourage testing by people who intend to use the map for the billing use case,Ã¢ÂÂ said Betsy Humphreys, deputy director, NLM. Ã¢ÂÂThe results from this test will inform and influence the development of related maps including SNOMED CT to ICD-10-CM [International Classifications of Diseases, 10th revision, Clinical Modification] and ICD-10-PCS [International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, Procedure Coding System].Ã¢ÂÂ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SNOMED Terminology SolutionsÃ¢ÂÂ¢ (STS), a division of the College of American Pathologists (CAP), developed the map on behalf of the NLM. CAP STS, and the American Health Information Management Association Foundation (AHIMA Foundation), on behalf of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), completed a collaborative review and validation of the draft map to ensure that the result accurately reflects the meaning and usage of ICD-9-CM. James Campbell, MD, at the University of Nebraska, was also instrumental in the development of this draft map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mapping is provided for the benefit of software vendors and the information technology community at large on the assumption that they will employ the data to create functionality to support semi-automated administrative and reimbursement reporting from a clinical data record that uses SNOMED CT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ã¢ÂÂThe final map will become a critical component for healthcare IT systems in the United States, linking SNOMED CT and ICD-9-CM for streamlined reimbursement and administrative reporting,Ã¢ÂÂ said Kevin Donnelly, vice president and general manager, CAP STS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For additional details contact Vivian Auld, Senior Specialist for Health Data Standards, National Library of Medicine, at (&lt;a href="mailto:auld@nlm.nih.gov"&gt;auld@nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;NLM Deputy Director Betsy L. Humphreys has been awarded the highest honor in the field of biomedical informatics. The American College of Medical Informatics (ACMI), the honorific college of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA), presented Ms. Humphreys with the 2009 Morris F. Collen Award of Excellence, named after a pioneer in the field of medical informatics. The Collen Award recognizes a body of work that has influenced biomedical informatics throughout an entire career. Ms. Humphreys was honored for her personal commitment and dedication to biomedical informatics, which has made a lasting impact on the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A graduate of Smith College, Ms. Humphreys came to the NLM in 1973 after finishing her master&amp;#39;s degree in library science at the University of Maryland, took on increasing responsibility, and became deputy director in 2005. Her unique achievements include coordinating NLM&amp;#39;s creation of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). UMLS is a collection of tools and resources that enable computer systems to link biomedical information from different sources, such as patient record systems and bibliographic databases. It also helps in the development of computer programs that behave as if they &amp;#34;understand&amp;#34; the meaning of the languages of biomedicine and health - so that when a user makes an inquiry, the program retrieves the relevant information. Before that she developed the SERHOLD database, which became the basis for NLM&amp;#39;s interlibrary loan system, DOCLINE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past Collen Award winners include NLM Director Dr. Donald A.B. Lindberg and Dr. Clem McDonald, director of the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American College of Medical Informatics is a college of elected fellows from the United States and abroad who have made significant and sustained contributions to the field of medical informatics. It exists as an elected body of fellows within AMIA, with its own bylaws and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â ###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM), the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and an arm of the National Institutes of Health, has been named a partner in a multi-centered grant to digitize materials in the history of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of five libraries participating in the digital Medical Heritage Project, NLM will receive $360,000 over the next two months to digitize items from its historical medical collections. The initiative is funded by a $1.5 million award to the Open Knowledge Commons, a nonprofit organization dedicated to building a universal digital library for democratic access to information, from the &lt;a href="http://www.sloan.org/"&gt;Alfred P. Sloan Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.Â Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 30,000 volumes of public domain works will be digitized from the collections of some of the world&amp;#39;s leading medical libraries: NLM, the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, the Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library at Yale University, the Augustus C. Long Health Sciences Library at Columbia University and the New York Public Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM will contribute digital versions of thousands of medical materials, including publications dating back to the 17th century.Â Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project will eventually make resources permanent and freely available through a digital library. Plans are to include more library partners and provide Web access to the collection.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/index.html"&gt;NLM History of Medicine Division&lt;/a&gt; collection includes 90 early western manuscripts (before 1600), 139 Arabic and Persian medical manuscripts, an East Asian collection of more than 2,000 printed books, manuscripts and visual materials, over 83,000 prints and photographs, all printed books in the NLM collection printed before 1914, thousands of later pamphlets and dissertations, and all pre-1871 journals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;Â ###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;More than 70 reports by the National Academies are available online at the National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s Bookshelf (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=napcollect"&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=napcollect&lt;/a&gt;). The Academies collection will continue to grow, both as new reports are published and as NLM processes older reports dating back to 1995. &lt;br /&gt;Â &lt;br /&gt;The reports include workshop summaries, as well as formal reports, that were funded by NIH and produced by the four organizations that comprise the National Academies: the National Academy of Sciences (&lt;a href="http://www.nasonline.org"&gt;http://www.nasonline.org&lt;/a&gt;), the National Academy of Engineering (http://www.nae.edu/nae/naehome.nsf), the Institute of Medicine (&lt;a href="http://www.iom.edu"&gt;http://www.iom.edu&lt;/a&gt;) and the National Research Council (http://sites.nationalacademies.org/nrc/index.htm).&lt;br /&gt;Â &lt;br /&gt;The reports are produced under a contract between NIH and the National Academies that allows NIH to issue task orders to fund Academy activities to support the NIH mission. The contract enables NIH and the Academies to address pressing policy concerns, emerging health issues, and scientific opportunities, and to post resulting reports on the Bookshelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to provide the reports quickly, NLM initially makes the reports available in PDF format. As soon as possible, NLM makes available a final online HTML version of each report, with active links for references, glossary words, and other resources. &lt;br /&gt;Â &lt;br /&gt;The Bookshelf (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books"&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books&lt;/a&gt;), a searchable, online collection of biomedical books and other material, is produced by NLM&amp;#39;s National Center for Biotechnology Information (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Daniel Nathans Photo" border="0" height="200" hspace="5" src="/news//nathan.jpg" vspace="5" width="150" /&gt; The National Library of Medicine, a constituent institute of the National Institutes of Health, in collaboration with the Alan Mason Chesney Medical Archives of The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions announces the release of an extensive selection from the papers of molecular biologist Daniel Nathans (1928-1999), who received the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his innovative use of restriction enzymes in analyzing virus genomes, on the Library&amp;#39;s Profiles in ScienceÂ® Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this addition, the number of prominent researchers, public health officials, and promoters of medical research whose personal and professional records are presented on Profiles has grown to thirty. The site is at &lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Dr. Nathans&amp;#39; work demonstrated the immense utility of restriction enzymes for genome analysis, and transformed molecular biology. Gene mapping, sequencing, cloning, and recombinant DNA technology would be inconceivable without the techniques he pioneered,&amp;#34; said Donald A. B. Lindberg, MD, director of the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born and raised in Wilmington, Delaware, Nathans majored in chemistry at the University of Delaware. He went on to medical school at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, planning initially to enter general practice. By the time he received his MD in 1954, however, several of his mentors had introduced him to the fascinating world of laboratory research. Nathans decided to pursue an academic medical career, combining teaching, research, and patient care. He did his internship at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York, and then spent two years as a clinical research fellow at the National Cancer Institute, where he began studying protein synthesis in tumor cells. Finding himself increasingly drawn to lab research during his subsequent medical residency, he became a full-time research associate at Fritz Lipmann&amp;#39;s laboratory at the Rockefeller Institute in 1959.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biochemists, microbiologists, and geneticists were rapidly forging the new discipline of molecular biology during the 1950s, resolving central questions about how the genetic material DNA directs living cells to manufacture the enzymes and structural proteins they need. At the Rockefeller Institute, Nathans joined these efforts, pursuing his interest in protein synthesis in bacteria and viruses. His most important project, carried out with Norton Zinder, showed that RNA could direct the synthesis of a specific protein, and supported the emerging idea that RNA might act as a &amp;#34;messenger&amp;#34; between cellular DNA and the protein-synthesizing &amp;#34;machinery&amp;#34; of cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nathans joined the faculty of the microbiology department at Johns Hopkins University in 1962, and continued investigating protein synthesis. Several years later he became interested in tumor viruses; like bacterial viruses, they promised to be excellent models of genetic mechanisms in the cells they infected. In 1969 he spent a six-month sabbatical at the Weizmann Institute in Israel, learning cell-culture techniques and getting acquainted with simian virus 40 (SV40), a small tumor virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Nathans was in Israel, Hamilton Smith, a JHU colleague, wrote to him about a new enzyme he&amp;#39;d found in Haemophilus influenzae bacteria, which seemed to cut the DNA of other species at particular points. Nathans recognized that such an enzyme would be useful for making uniform fragments of a small virus DNA that could then be mapped, i.e., the precise molecular structure determined. Returning to JHU, he immediately set to work testing Smith&amp;#39;s enzyme and several other known restriction enzymes on the SV40. As he hoped, the Haemophilus restriction enzyme cut the SV40 DNA into eleven specific fragments. He and his graduate student Kathleen Danna then proceeded to deduce the physical order of the fragments and to discover the point where DNA replication started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restriction enzymes rapidly became essential tools, stimulating a rapid expansion of discovery in molecular biology. In subsequent work, Nathans and his associates constructed physical maps of the SV40 genome, and used restriction enzymes to create mutant forms of the virus in which certain DNA segments were deleted. These mutants were reintroduced into the host cells and assessed for biological activity. In the latter part of his career, hoping to learn more about how cancerous processes began, Nathans shifted from tumor viruses to the study of cultured mouse cells, investigating the effects of substances called growth factors on cell reproduction. He and his co-workers isolated and characterized some of the first cellular genes that were activated when cells were stimulated to grow and divide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though widely acknowledged as a first-rate researcher, teacher, and mentor, Nathans was also an able administrator-- thoughtful, fair, deliberate, and clearheaded. (One colleague noted that Nathans had &amp;#34;the highest signal-to-noise ratio of anyone&amp;#34; he&amp;#39;d ever known.) He was director of the Microbiology Department at JHU from 1972 to 1982, and then served as Senior Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes unit there from 1981 to 1999. He served on many national scientific committees, and as Interim President of JHU during 1995-96, guiding the institution through a time of difficult transitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profiles in Science features correspondence, published articles, notebook excerpts, report drafts, and photographs from the Daniel Nathans Papers at the Alan Mason Chesney Medical Archives of The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. Visitors to the site can view, for example, excerpts from Nathans&amp;#39; medical school notebooks, laboratory notebooks and correspondence reflecting his early work with restriction enzymes, reports and correspondence relating to his administration of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute unit at Johns Hopkins, and letters between Nathans and Paul Berg, Maxine Singer, and Ernest Winocour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

Midwifery came under public scrutiny in the 1910s when progressive reformers blamed the &amp;#34;unsanitary practices&amp;#34; of midwives for the higher rate of maternal and infant deaths. During the next two decades reformers campaigned unsuccessfully to eliminate the practice of midwifery. There simply were not enough skilled physicians or hospital facilities in southern rural communities. Poverty and pervasive racial discrimination also made home births more desirable than hospital deliveries to many of the African American families living in rural counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"&gt;Training midwives was deemed the only viable solution in the South were African Americans midwives were predominate. Midwives received instruction from public health nurses during annual state-sponsored institutes and monthly local midwives clubs. Classes, which emphasized sanitary delivery practices, were taught by demonstration, songs and role playing. From the 1920s through the 1960s this next generation of midwives continued in the tradition of their &amp;#34;granny&amp;#34; predecessors with the added benefit of scientific knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Midwives at bed" border="0" height="177" hspace="5" src="/news//midwives2.jpg" vspace="5" width="221" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"&gt;Through photographs and artifacts, the exhibit tells a story about state and local training programs designed to educate the &amp;#34;granny&amp;#34; midwife. It highlights, midwives their nurse-midwife instructors and the many ways in which African American midwives contributed to improvements in maternal and infant care in the rural South-despite early reform efforts to eradicate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The exhibition, inside and outside the NLM History of Medicine Division Reading Room, Building 38, first floor, runs from February 2010 to June 2010.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Interactive Web Site Helps Reunite Family Members and Loved Ones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM), the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and an arm of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), announces the release of the &lt;a href="http://hepl.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;Haiti Earthquake People Locator (HEPL)&lt;/a&gt;, a new system that can assist in the reunification of family members and loved ones during the ongoing relief efforts in Haiti. HEPL consists of an interactive Web site that provides information about people who have been found in Haiti or who are still missing after the devastating earthquake of January 12, 2010. The site allows members of the public to search for people who have been located by medical staff and other relief workers in Haiti as well as to voluntarily post information about people who are still missing. Medical and relief personnel in the region can submit photographs and descriptive information about located people via computer, cell phone, or a specialized &amp;#34;Found in Haiti&amp;#34; iPhone application that was developed by the NLM. Using data from this app, the site can even show the GPS coordinates of the spot where he was found. The HEPL system also has a meta-search engine, allowing it to simultaneously search multiple sites set up by CNN, Google and the International Red Cross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HEPL system, developed by NLM&amp;#39;s Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, shares information with other person finder systems, including the one recommended by the US Department of State (Google&amp;#39;s Person Finder), to ensure that all searches operate across the largest possible set of matches. Based in part on the open-source Sahana disaster management system, HEPL&amp;#39;s technology was developed by the NLM as part of its R&amp;#38;D contribution to the Bethesda Hospitals Emergency Preparedness Partnership (BHEPP), a collaboration of the NLM, the NIH Clinical Center, the National Naval Medical Center and Suburban Hospital/Johns Hopkins Medicine, to improve emergency response capabilities in the National Capital Region and also serve as a model for the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Haiti Earthquake People Locator (HEPL): &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://hepl.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://hepl.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In celebration of African American History Month, the National Library of Medicine (NLM), the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and an arm of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), will host&lt;em&gt; Within these Walls: Contraband Hospital and the African Americans Who Served There&lt;/em&gt;, a panel exhibition, weekdays through March 31, 2010, 9:00 AM-4:00 PM. It will be displayed inside the interior glass doors of the first floor lobby of Building 38A, the Lister Hill Center, on the Bethesda, Maryland campus of the NIH. The exhibition is free and open to the public. It was curated by Jill L. Newmark of the NLM History of Medicine Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unique exhibition brings to light a story not known to many Americans, about Contraband Hospital in Washington, DC, which provided care to fugitive slaves and African American soldiers during the Civil War. Through personal stories, observations, photographs and historical documents, &lt;em&gt;Within These Walls&lt;/em&gt; documents the efforts of unsung Africans American surgeons and nurses to provide care and comfort to black soldiers and civilians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NLM will host a special program, Tuesday, February 23, 2010 at 11:00 AM in its Lister Hill Auditorium, near the exhibition site. The event will feature:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remarks by assistant director and curator of the African American Civil War Memorial and Museum, Hari Jones, a retired Marine Corps captain and historian specializing in African American military service history;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A special presentation by members of the African American Ladies of the Civil War&amp;#39;s group, Female RE-Enactors of Distinction (FREED), affiliated with the African American Civil War Museum. Dressed in period costume, actresses will bring to life: Elizabeth Keckley, an African American seamstress who, among other achievements, opened her own business in Washington and became First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln&amp;#39;s dressmaker and friend (and who, on the night of Abraham Lincoln&amp;#39;s assassination, was summoned by Mrs. Lincoln to Petersen House, where he lay dying, for comfort); and Hallie Quinn Brown, a prominent African American activist, educator and elocutionist; and&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibition tours, following the program.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington, DC became a beacon of freedom after President Lincoln signed the DC Emancipation Act in April 1862, freeing all slaves in the District of Columbia. Not surprisingly, large numbers of fugitive slaves, known as &amp;#34;contraband,&amp;#34; escaped to the nation&amp;#39;s capital for a taste of freedom. To meet the needs of the growing contraband population, the Union Army established the Contraband Camp and Hospital in Northwest Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contraband Hospital employed seven of the 13 African American surgeons (many of whom were trained in Canada or Great Britain) who served the Union Army during the war.

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Renowned NIH Scientist Played Leading Role in Deciphering Genetic Code,&lt;br /&gt;Donated Papers to the National Library of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Marshall Nirenberg poses with molecular model" border="0" height="314" hspace="5" src="/news/nirenberg.jpg" vspace="5" width="220" /&gt; Marshall Warren Nirenberg, an internationally recognized scientist who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1968 for deciphering the genetic code, died of cancer at his home in New York City on January 15. He was 82 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The world of medicine has a lost a giant,&amp;#34; said Dr. Donald A.B. Lindberg, director of the National Library of Medicine (NLM). &amp;#34;Marshall Nirenberg&amp;#39;s ground-breaking research on deciphering the genetic code was a landmark achievement of the 20th century.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marshall Warren Nirenberg was born April 10, 1927, in New York City, but the family moved to Florida because Nirenberg developed rheumatic fever. He became an adept observer of plant life, insects, and birds, and captured these observations through carefully written and maintained notes. Nirenberg earned his BS degree in zoology and chemistry in 1948 from the University of Florida in Gainesville and his MS degree from the same University in 1952.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later that year, Nirenberg moved to Ann Arbor to attend the University of Michigan. In 1957, he earned a PhD in biological chemistry by writing a dissertation on the uptake of hexose, a type of sugar, by tumor cells. This work served as the basis of his first published article and shaped the direction of his initial studies after graduate school. In 1959, Nirenberg was chosen as a postdoctoral fellow of the Public Health Service&amp;#39;s Section on Metabolic Enzymes at the National Institute of Arthritis, Metabolism, and Digestive Diseases (NIAMDD), a part of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. The following year, Nirenberg joined the staff as a research biochemist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1959, Nirenberg began his investigations into the relationship between deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA) and the production of proteins. With J. Heinrich Matthaei, a researcher from Bonn, Germany, he initiated a series of experiments using synthetic RNA. The two scientists were able to show how RNA transmits the &amp;#34;messages&amp;#34; that are encoded in DNA and direct how amino acids combine to make proteins. These experiments became the foundation of Nirenberg&amp;#39;s groundbreaking work on the genetic code, which he first made public at the International Congress of Biochemistry in Moscow in August 1961. By early 1962, the significance of these early experiments was recognized throughout the world, after the popular media highlighted the importance of their work as a major scientific breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this same period, Nirenberg was offered professorships at a number of major universities across the United States, but decided to stay at NIH. In 1962, he was appointed chief of the Section on Biochemical Genetics at the NIH&amp;#39;s National Heart Institute (NHI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Nirenberg on phone" border="0" height="314" hspace="5" src="/news/nobel.jpg" vspace="5" width="213" /&gt; By 1966, Nirenberg had deciphered all the RNA &amp;#34;codons&amp;#34; - the term used to describe the &amp;#34;code words&amp;#34; of messenger RNA - for all 20 major amino acids. Two years later, in 1968, Nirenberg received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for &amp;#34;interpretation of the genetic code and its function in protein synthesis.&amp;#34; He shared the award with Robert W. Holley of Cornell University and Har Gobind Khorana of the University of Wisconsin at Madison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Nirenberg&amp;#39;s research on the genetic code, he turned to the field of neurobiology. The new scientific arena gave Nirenberg the freedom to ask new questions, solve new problems, and explore new biological puzzles. Nirenberg would devote the next thirty years of his scientific career to the investigation of various aspects of neurobiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marshall Nirenberg&amp;#39;s scientific papers, correspondence, published articles, and photographs are featured on the Profiles in Science Web site, &lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt;. Profiles celebrates 20th century leaders in biomedical research and public health by making the archival collections of these prominent scientists, physicians, and others who have advanced the scientific enterprise available to the public through modern digital technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get even more &amp;#34;up close and personal&amp;#34; with Dr. Nirenberg, visitors to the NLM may also conduct a virtual interview with Nirenberg, asking questions about his research in a user-friendly format called &amp;#34;Dialogues in Science.&amp;#34; This voice-activated program is accessible in the NLM Visitor Center, on the first floor of Building 38A, the Lister Hill Center, Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, except on federal holidays or when tour groups are using the facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;# # #&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Based on Popular Exhibition, Site Showcases 20th-century Public Health Posters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Iconography of Contagion: A Web Exhibition of 20th-century Health Posters&lt;/em&gt; has been launched in a new online version, on the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Web site, at &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/iconographyofcontagion/index.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/iconographyofcontagion/index.html&lt;/a&gt;. NLM is the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and an arm of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site, which is adapted from the exhibition of the same name, hosted by the National Academy of Sciences in 2008, features more than 20 health posters from the 1920s to the 1990s, from North America, Europe, Asia and Africa. Using images that are by turns beautiful, humorous, jarring and unexpected, they cover infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS, gonorrhea and syphilis. In pictures, text and captions, &lt;em&gt;An Iconography of Contagion&lt;/em&gt; shows the interplay between medical science, politics, public understanding of disease, war, and cultural values and prejudices. It was curated by medical historian Michael Sappol in NLM&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health took a visual turn about 100 years ago. In an era of devastating epidemic and endemic infectious disease, health professionals began to organize coordinated campaigns that sought to mobilize public and government action through eye-catching posters, pamphlets and motion pictures. Impressed by the images of mass media that increasingly saturated the world around them, health campaigners were inspired to present new figures of contagion, and recycle old ones, using modernist aesthetics, graphic manipulations, humor, dramatic lighting, painterly abstraction, distortions of perspective and other visual strategies. They devised a new iconography of contagion that emphasized visual legibility and the pleasure of the view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;Iconography of Contagion&lt;/em&gt;, the physical exhibition, is on tour through Cultural Programs of the National Academy of Sciences. For booking information, please contact Alana Quinn at &lt;a href="mailto:aquinn@nas.edu"&gt;aquinn@nas.edu&lt;/a&gt; and 202.334.2415.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Exhibition Touring Schedule:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;September 28, 2009 - January 29, 2010&lt;br /&gt;Global Health Odyssey Museum&lt;br /&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;br /&gt;Atlanta, GA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 15, 2010 - May 28, 2010&lt;br /&gt;Claude Moore Health Sciences Library&lt;br /&gt;University of Virginia&lt;br /&gt;Charlottesville, VA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Images from the exhibition:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;table border="0"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img alt="Atisch.

The new offering is at &lt;a href="http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/flash/smith/smith.html"&gt;http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/flash/smith/smith.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="items"&gt;&lt;div class="columnA" style="width:45%;"&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image of scroll" border="align=&amp;#34;left&amp;#34;" height="325" hspace="4" src="/news//scroll.jpg" vspace="4" width="399" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnB" style="width:50%;"&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Example of Translation Feature" border="0" height="325" hspace="5" src="/news//translation.jpg" vspace="5" width="399" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Smith Papyrus was written in Egyptian hieratic script around the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century BCE but probably based on material from a thousand years earlier. This collaborative online representation features an important new translation by James P. Allen, formerly of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and high-resolution scans lent by the scroll&amp;#39;s owner, the New York Academy of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &amp;#34;We are delighted to collaborate with NLM in bringing the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus to a much wider audience and the use of interactive technology will allow researchers and the public to explore the document more deeply,&amp;#34; said Academy President Jo Ivey Boufford, MD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The Smith Papyrus is extremely important,&amp;#34; added NLM Director Donald A.B. Lindberg, MD, &amp;#34;because it showed for the first time that Egyptians had a scientific understanding of traumatic injuries based on observable anatomy rather than relying on magic or potions.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The text is a treatise on trauma surgery and consists of 48 cases dealing with wounds and trauma. Each case is laid out using a carefully prescribed formula: a description of the injury; diagnosis; prognosis; treatment; and further explanations of the case, which resemble footnotes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;This papyrus is unlike most other medical papyri in that it is chiefly rational and does not usually bring the supernatural into the explanations or treatments for injuries-for instance, there is only one incantation,&amp;#34; said Michael North, curator of the project and of rare books in the Library&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for potential viewers of the scroll, the computer scientists at the National Library of Medicine also relied on sound scientific principles rather than magic to devise a system that allows the unfurling of the scroll on a computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The technical challenges of digitally transforming and making this scroll available on a personal computer were enormous,&amp;#34; said George Thoma, PhD, chief of the Communications Engineering Branch at NLM&amp;#39;s Lister Hill Center. Thoma led the Library&amp;#39;s technical efforts and team. &amp;#34;The memory requirements were immense, so we had to come up with ways to manage the memory for home use. We created the illusion of rolling and unrolling by superimposing the frame by frame animation of the rolled section of the scroll on the large image of the entire papyrus.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, creative animation techniques, dealing with bend modifying and lattice deformation, were necessary in order for the scroll to unroll and flip over correctly. Also, to explore the graceful, two-color calligraphy, a &amp;#34;zoom&amp;#34; mode offers a roving magnifying window, the design for which came with its own complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM computer scientists were also faced with the challenge of putting the scroll back together in the first place. When Edwin Smith, an American dealer and collector of antiquities, acquired the papyrus in Egypt in 1862, it consisted of a single scroll about 15 feet long with some loose fragments, but it was cut into 17 columns sometime in the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. The leaves had to be digitally &amp;#34;stitched&amp;#34; together to recreate the original appearance of the scroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;As far as I know, we may be the only Library in the world that has mastered the computation and technology to create an easily usable virtual scroll for a personal computerÂ  user,&amp;#34; Dr. Thoma added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British Library created &lt;em&gt;Turning The Pages&lt;/em&gt;, but NLM has collaborated with that institution to create its own version. There are now six books, in addition to the scroll, in the online version. Two touch-screen versions are also on view at the National Library of Medicine, on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;em&gt;Turning The Pages&lt;/em&gt; technical requirements for computers: &lt;a href="http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/requirements.htm"&gt;http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/requirements.htm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;# # #&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Harry Truman was President, gas cost 15 cents a gallon, the transistor was invented, and internationally renowned surgeon Dr. Michael DeBakey was publishing articles on the US Army&amp;#39;s World War II experience with battle injuries, military surgery, and the use of streptomycin therapy. Citations to these and more than 60,000 other articles indexed in the 1947 &lt;em&gt;Current List of Medical Literature&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;CLML&lt;/em&gt;) are now available in the National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s MEDLINE/PubMed database (&lt;a href="http://www.pubmed.gov"&gt;www.pubmed.gov&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the original MEDLINE database made its debut in 1971, it contained citations to journal articles mostly published from approximately 1966 forward. NLM began to expand the retrospective coverage of the database in 1996, when more than 307,000 citations originally published in the 1964 and 1965 &lt;em&gt;Cumulated Index Medicus &lt;/em&gt;were made available as OLDMEDLINE. The Library has been moving steadily backward in time ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although 1947 may seem far back in the rear view mirror of history, important articles in biomedicine appeared that year and may hold vital lessons for research in the 21st century. &amp;#34;Some contemporary medical questions can only be answered by consulting the older literature,&amp;#34; observed NLM Director Dr. Donald A.B. Lindberg. &amp;#34;NLM is working to make the journal citations in older printed indexes electronically searchable, and our goal is to go back at least as far as World War II.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the addition of the 1947 citations, the MEDLINE/PubMed subset now contains over 20 million citations produced during 63 years of indexing of the biomedical literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For additional information about the data conversion project, go to: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/databases_oldmedline.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/databases_oldmedline.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;# # #&lt;/p&gt;

Taine&lt;/strong&gt;, former Project Director, Index Mechanization Project and former Chief, Bibliographic Services Division, National Library of Medicine died February 21, 2010 in Sonoma, California. He was 90. Mr. Taine first joined the then Army Medical Library (precursor of the National Library of Medicine) as a subject cataloger in 1949 but quickly assumed senior positions as Editor-in-Chief of &lt;em&gt;Current List of Medical Literature&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bibliography of Medical Reviews&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Index Medicus&lt;/em&gt; and the final editor of the &lt;em&gt;Index-Catalogue&lt;/em&gt;.Â  He obtained his master&amp;#39;s in library science from Columbia University and brought an undergraduate degree in Chemistry from New York University and two years of Dental School to his career in medical librarianship.Â  Mr. Taine left the Library in 1964, for positions at the National Science Foundation and NASA, and served as Director of the NIH Library from 1968-1972. He returned to NLM briefly in 1972 before assuming the position of Chief Librarian at World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Taine&amp;#39;s career at the now National Library of Medicine spanned the years in which the Library significantly changed its role by opening up access to the world&amp;#39;s biomedical literature through the use of mechanization and computers. He was instrumental in ending the publication of the &lt;em&gt;Index-Catalogue&lt;/em&gt; and envisioning the future, working with former NLM Director Frank Bradway Rogers on the creation of MEDLARS (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System).Â  MEDLARS Â laid the foundation for online retrieval of citations to the biomedical literature. Mr. Taine authored or co-authored a number of publications on MEDLARS, including one with Scott Adams, Deputy Director of the National Library of Medicine, published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, titled, Searching the medical literature. Information retrieval (MEDLARS) at the National Library of Medicine [1964; 188:251-4]. Â Â Today, the MEDLINE/PubMed database - a direct descendent of MEDLARS - contains more than 20,000,000 citations and many links to full-text articles in PubMed Central and on publishers&amp;#39; websites, to genomic data, and to many other information resources.Â Â  It is searched millions of times every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM is pleased to note that Mr. Taine&amp;#39;s work continues to serve the biomedical community.Â  The Library has been gradually digitizing and adding to the database citations to literature indexed prior to the advent of MEDLARS.Â  Citations to all of the articles indexed under Mr. Taine&amp;#39;s supervision in the 1950s and early 1960s are readily searchable in PubMed today.Â  Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

It features a poster &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;within the poster-an illustration of a skeleton riding on a mosquito, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;with a caption in large Chinese characters at the top. It translates as, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;Prevention means killing the mosquito; frightening diseased mosquito &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;carries hell to planet earth and spreads epidemic disease.&amp;#34; The illustration &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;has a beige inner border and a thin gray border, setting it off from the black &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;background of the main poster. The eerie skeleton and mosquito are flying &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ver a field, with a building representing Chinese architecture in the background. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, announces &amp;#34;Health for the People,&amp;#34; a new Web exhibit focusing on Chinese public health posters and other paper ephemera. You can explore it atÃÂ  &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/healthforthepeople/index.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/healthforthepeople/index.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acquired by the Library in 2006, the Chinese poster collection consists of about 3,000 items. &amp;#34;We probably have the largest collection of Chinese public health posters outside of China,&amp;#34; said Paul Theerman, PhD, chief of Images and Archives in the History of Medicine Division. ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collection is mostly made up of posters from the People&amp;#39;s Republic (or post-revolutionary) era, from the 1950s through the 1970s. In the days before the Internet and the 24/7 news cycle, the Chinese government relied on posters to get health messages out to its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organized into four the sections, the posters urge citizens to pursue healthy habits. For example, in the &lt;em&gt;Children&amp;#39;s Section&lt;/em&gt;, a poster encourages children to, ÃÂ &amp;#34;Love Cleanliness and Sanitation.&amp;#34; A series of transparencies teaches children how to admit their mistakes and correct their peers&amp;#39; inappropriate behavior. A poster in the &lt;em&gt;Family Planning Section&lt;/em&gt; encourages women to carry out family planning for the revolution, while &lt;em&gt;the Medical Advertisement Section &lt;/em&gt;touts the benefits of progesterone and methyltestosterone, potent over-the-counter hormone therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Four Pests Section&lt;/em&gt; presents posters from a 1958 campaign focused on rats, sparrows, flies and mosquitoes. &amp;#34;Eradicate pests and diseases and build happiness for ten thousand generations,&amp;#34; urges one poster. The campaigns were short-lived and unsuccessful; more enduring were the efforts to improve water quality and waste treatment, which led to dramatic reductions in the epidemic diseases of cholera, plague and typhoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese were far more successful with their anti-malaria campaign. In 1950, over 30 million Chinese people suffered from malaria; one percent of those died. The Chinese Government launched a major campaign in the 1950s, stressing the importance of timely treatment of the disease, but mostly emphasizing preventive measures. The colorful posters encourage citizens to eliminate the breeding grounds of mosquitoes, to keep houses and livestock clean, fill in the ditches, use bed nets, and screen doors and windows. (A special online section deals with these posters, at &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/chineseantimalaria/"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/chineseantimalaria/&lt;/a&gt;.) By the 1990s, China had made major inroads in the fight against malaria. In 1998, there were only 32,000 malaria cases in ChinaÃ¢ÂÂa drop of 99 percent, compared to 1954.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The use of health posters to convey medical information has dropped drastically,&amp;#34; noted HMD&amp;#39;s Theerman. &amp;#34;Television and the Internet are ubiquitousÃ¢ÂÂeven in third world countries-and they have replaced posters as the major way of getting health information out to various populations.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can view a larger selection of the Chinese Health Posters at:ÃÂ  &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/chineseposters/index.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/chineseposters/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The National Library of Medicine has one of the largest collections of health posters in the world, numbering close to 12,500. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;View posters, prints, photographs and other medical artworks in the NLM Images from the History of Medicine database &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;at &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/ihm/"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/ihm/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Love Cleanliness and Sanitation" src="/news/lovecleanliness.jpg" title="Love Cleanliness and Sanitation" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ã¢ÂÂ&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and component of the National Institutes of Health, announces a new exhibition featuring nine of its illustrated incunabula or &amp;#34;cradle-books,&amp;#34; as rare-book librarians sometimes call these volumes. It will be on view in Building 38, on the Bethesda, Maryland campus of NIH, through June 18. The books range in subject matter from early hand-colored herbals and astrological charts to manuals on how to treat the plague and venereal diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incunabula are books printed in Europe using movable metal type from its invention in about 1455 until 1500. In Latin, &amp;#34;incunabula&amp;#34; means &amp;#34;swaddling clothes&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;cradle,&amp;#34; and rare book librarians and historians have long used the term to refer to these books from the infancy of printing. Of the Library&amp;#39;s 580 incunabula, about 70 of them are illustrated with woodcuts, many of them considered to be some of the greatest printed artwork of the age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibition includes NLM&amp;#39;s copy of &lt;em&gt;The Nuremberg Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;, the largest incunable in its collection, measuring nearly 20 inches in height. The &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; is a history of the world beginning with the Garden of Eden and extending to the medieval period; it was written by the physician Hartmann Schedel and printed in 1493. It is known for its beautiful woodcuts depicting panoramas of famous cities, portraits of famous rulers and thinkers, and important historical events. Illustrators include the noted Renaissance artists Albrecht DÃ¼rer and Michael Wolgemut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on display is the Library&amp;#39;s hand-colored copy of the &lt;em&gt;Gart der Gesundheit &lt;/em&gt;(Mainz, 1485), or &amp;#34;Garden of Health,&amp;#34; the first herbal printed in a vernacular language (German), rather than Latin or Greek. As with many early herbals, the author and artist are unknown, but its printer was Peter Schoeffer, who assisted as an apprentice in composing the type for the Gutenberg Bible some thirty years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other works in the exhibition include a uniquely held copy of &lt;em&gt;Anianus&amp;#39; Computus cum Commento&lt;/em&gt; (Lyon, 1492), a manual for calculating the dates of Lent and Easter using the hands as a mnemonic device, and a copy of Hieronymus BrÃ¼nschwig&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Liber Pestilentialis de Venenis Epidimie&lt;/em&gt;, printed in Strassbourg in 1500. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is on display in the History of Medicine Division Reading Room, on the first floor of Building 38, from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. For more information, please contact the curator of the exhibition, Michael North, Head, Rare Books &amp;#38; Early Manuscripts, at &lt;a href="mailto:northm@mail.nih.gov"&gt;northm@mail.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;, or the History of Medicine Division Reading Room at 301.402.8878.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img alt="A hand colored woodcut of the zodiac constellation Sagittarius from Johannes Angelus" src="/news/cradlebooks.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hand colored woodcut of the zodiac constellation Sagittarius from: Johannes Angelus, &lt;em&gt;Astrolabium Planum&lt;/em&gt; (Augsburg: Erhardt Ratdolt, 1488).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Physician assistants have a new tool to help their patients find quality health information on the Internet. The American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA) is now part of the National Library of Medicine Information Rx program. The partnership was formally launched at the 2010 AAPA annual conference held over the Memorial Day weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Information Rx program, physician assistants can order special, free &amp;#34;prescription pads&amp;#34; and use them during office visits to &amp;#34;prescribe&amp;#34; information from NLM&amp;#39;s consumer health Web site, MedlinePlus.gov.Â  For example, when treating someone with asthma, a physician assistant can use the special prescription pad to direct the patient to accurate and easy-to-understand information about asthma on MedlinePlus. Â The site includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;more than 800 health topics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;interactive tutorials for people with low literacy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a medical dictionary&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;an illustrated medical encyclopedia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;directories of hospitals and providers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;surgical videos&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;information in English and Spanish, with selected materials in nearly 50 other languages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM initiated its Information Rx program: to help people better understand health information; to enhance conversations between healthcare providers and patients; and to encourage the use of evidence-based health information on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Part of a health care provider&amp;#39;s job is to explain illnesses, diagnoses and treatments to patients,&amp;#34; said Donald A.B. Lindberg, MD, Director of the National Library of Medicine. &amp;#34;MedlinePlus provides authoritative, user-friendly and commercial-free information that physician assistants can use to supplement information provided in the office or clinic.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the AAPA, three other healthcare associations have partnered with NLM on Information Rx. They are the American College of Physicians Foundation, the National Medical Association, and the American Osteopathic Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the Information Rx program, or to order free prescription pads and other materials, visit the Information Rx Web site, &lt;a href="http://www.informationrx.org/"&gt;http://www.informationrx.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;New Resource Will Enhance Exchange of Drug Information among Computerized Systems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective with the RxNorm release on Monday, June 7th, the National Library of Medicine (NLM), the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and an arm of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), will add the US Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration (VHA) National Drug File-Reference Terminology (NDF-RT) as a source vocabulary in its RxNorm database (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/).Â  RxNorm is a standardized nomenclature for clinical drugs, produced by NLM, which includes and links many source vocabularies that are commonly used in pharmacy management and electronic medical record systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The June release of RxNorm, including NDFRT, is available at &lt;a href="http://download.nlm.nih.gov/umls/kss/rxnorm/RxNorm_full_06072010.zip"&gt;http://download.nlm.nih.gov/umls/kss/rxnorm/RxNorm_full_06072010.zip&lt;/a&gt;. A UMLS Metathesaurus license is required and can be obtained free of charge from the same site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NDF-RT is a terminology used to classify drugs according to their clinical properties, including mechanism of action, physiologic effect, therapeutic category, structural class and the established pharmacologic class used by the FDA. It is an extension of the VHA National Drug File (VANDF), another RxNorm source vocabulary. The addition of NDF-RT to RxNorm is a major step towards achieving interoperability of computerized drug information systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 29, 2010, NLM and VHA signed an agreement enabling NDF-RT data to be included in the RxNorm monthly releases. It will continue to be released as a source in Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information regarding NDF-RT specifically, please contact Michael Lincoln at michael.lincoln@va.gov. Questions about the RxNorm representation of NDF-RT should be sent to &lt;a href="mailto:rxnorminfo@nlm.nih.gov"&gt;rxnorminfo@nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

It is drawn from the Henkel Family Letters collection covering more than a century of life in Virginia&amp;#39;s Shenandoah Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Henkel family settled in New Market, Virginia in 1790. Generations of fathers and sons studied medicine. Over the course of their careers, these physicians ministered to their community, tended to their countrymen on the battlefield, and testified in the nation&amp;#39;s courts of law. Â The letters of the Henkel family richly document the daily life of men in medicine in the nineteenth century and reveal the challenges of the profession as well as the rewards and responsibilities. Their writings colorfully represent the range of events in everyday life, from the minute details of local issues to the national crisis of the Civil War. The missives convey the concerns and characters of the authors, vividly illustrating the writers&amp;#39; personalities, and their experiences as physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance in a letter to Caspar C. Henkel from childhood friend Benjamin F. Graves dated August 28, 1861 while encamped on the Greenbriar River, Benjamin marveled at the sublime beauty of his surroundings as he prayed &amp;#34;for our final deliverance from the hands of our enemy, that is now polluting the soil of Western Virginia with their unhallowed feet.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site contains the complete collection of transcribed letters alongside images of the originals. Curators normalized the majority of place names, general subject terms, and MeSH terms (Medical Subject Headings) to aid searching and browsing. The original spellings are enhanced by pop-up window links that display the normalized phrase. All spellings and verbiage are those of the original writers; no editorial interventions were made, although some layouts differ to enhance readability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This site marks AMMP&amp;#39;s first XML encoded text collection using the DLXS software. The encoded texts conform to the TEI Level 4 (Text Encoding Initiative) specifications, a markup language developed for encoding humanities texts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Conception, Transcriptions/Scanning, Content Development:&lt;/strong&gt; Jim Labosier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Coordinator, Site Design, and Development:&lt;/strong&gt; John Rees&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for Nominations:&lt;/strong&gt; As the U.S. Member of the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation (IHTSDO), the National Library of Medicine (NLM) is soliciting nominations of potential candidates for the four IHTSDO Standing Committees Ã¢ÂÂ Content, Quality Assurance, Implementation &amp;#38; Innovation (&lt;em&gt;formerly&lt;/em&gt; Research &amp;#38; Innovation), and Technical. These Committees have important roles in the ongoing development of the SNOMED CT clinical terminology and in the IHTSDO. Nominations are &lt;strong&gt;due to NLM by COB July 14, 2010&lt;/strong&gt; (see details &lt;a href="#below"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current roster, terms of reference, and recent reports of each Committee are available on the IHTSDO website (&lt;a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org/about-ihtsdo/governance-and-advisory/standing-committees/"&gt;http://www.ihtsdo.org/about-ihtsdo/governance-and-advisory/standing-committees/&lt;/a&gt;). The Committees are described in &lt;a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Docs_01/About_IHTSDO/Articles_of_Association/May2009/001122.htm#_Toc231803482"&gt;Sections 9.4-9.9 of the Articles of the IHTSDO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half of each Standing CommitteeÃ¢ÂÂs 12 members are serving terms that expire in December 2010. People elected to these slots will serve for 2 years (Jan. 2011-Dec. 2012). There may be additional Committee vacancies caused by resignations. People elected to fill these mid-term slots will serve for 1 year (Jan-Dec. 2011). Committee members whose terms are expiring are eligible for re-nomination, but must submit a nomination package (see details &lt;a href="#below"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;). As a result of changes to the IHTSDO Articles approved in April 2009, the majority of the positions on each Committee are at-large seats and may be filled by people nominated by IHTSDO Members from any geographic region. At present the Americas region includes the U.S. and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Nomination Process:&lt;/strong&gt; All U.S. SNOMED CT Affiliate Licensees (aka, all U.S. UMLS Licensees) may vote to select the U.S. candidates for IHTSDO Committees. The timeline for nominations and elections is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 18, 2010 Ã¢ÂÂ July 14, 2010:&lt;/strong&gt; NLM accepts nominations of potential candidates for the four IHTSDO Standing Committees. Only candidates with complete nomination packets will be accepted (see &lt;a href="#below"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt; for details, and required forms).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 19, 2010 Ã¢ÂÂ August 16, 2010:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. SNOMED CT Affiliates cast votes for their top three candidates for each Standing Committee. Instructions for casting ballots will be sent to U.S. SNOMED CT Affiliates on July 19th. For each Committee, the three candidates receiving the highest number of votes will become the U.S. nominees for the Committee.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 1, 2010:&lt;/strong&gt; NLM will submit the names of the three (3) candidates receiving the highest number of votes as nominees for each of the four Committees to the IHTSDO for consideration by the IHTSDO General Assembly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 15, 2010:&lt;/strong&gt; IHTSDO will announce the final results of the election process at the General Assembly Meeting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Committee Obligations and Participation Logistics:&lt;/strong&gt; English is the official language of the IHTSDO, but Committee Members must be willing to take extra steps to ensure understanding by those for whom English is a second language. Teleconference arrangements are available for all Committee meetings, but, given the geographic distribution of IHTSDO members (currently Australia, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States), meeting schedules cannot be convenient for all relevant time zones. The IHTSDO encourages Committee Members to attend at least one of the two major IHTSDO meetings each year in person.

    <body>&lt;h1&gt;&amp;#34;An Odyssey of Knowledge&amp;#34;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An online exhibition produced by the U.S. National Library of Medicine:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/odysseyofknowledge/index.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/odysseyofknowledge/index.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visiting Curator: Alain Touwaide, Ph.D., Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicine in the Old World arose from many components: the classical Greek tradition, its Christian re-elaboration, the contributions of the Arab World, and the unique medieval synthesis of them all.Â  The exhibition uses significant images from manuscripts and early printed books of the National Library of Medicine to show how these cultures around the Mediterranean Sea contributed to the creation of medical knowledge in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featuring 21 medieval manuscripts and five early printed texts scanned at high resolution, An Odyssey of Knowledge displays some of the most prized items held by the National Library of Medicine. It gives viewers a rare look at texts that are normally kept under lock and key, containing medical knowledge which spans over two millennia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Odyssey of Knowledge was originally created as a travelling exhibition for the International Society for the History of Medicine&amp;#39;s 39th International Congress on the History of Medicine, held from in August 2004, in Bari, Italy. It was also displayed at the National Library of Rome, and at venues in Paris, Geneva, and Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about the websiteÂ and the Library&amp;#39;s early manuscript collection, please contact Michael North (&lt;a href="mailto:northm@mail.nih.gov"&gt;northm@mail.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;), Head of Rare Books and Early Manuscripts in the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd"&gt;History of Medicine Division&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/odysseyofknowledge/images/NLM35.jpg" title="Manuscript Page"&gt;&lt;img align="bottom" alt="Image caption: Manuscript with illuminated initial " border="0" height="317" src="/news/odyssey_book.jpg" width="250" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manuscript with illuminated initial &amp;#34;M&amp;#34; from: the Isagoge of Hunayn Ibn Ishaq al-&amp;#39;Ibadi (809-873), copied on vellum in Paris, ca. 1220.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine is pleased to announce the 2010-2011 year of the leadership program jointly sponsored with the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries (AAHSL). The NLM/AAHSL Leadership Fellows Program is focused on preparing emerging leaders for the position of library director in academic health sciences libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM director Donald A. B. Lindberg said, &amp;#34;We are impressed with the successes of this leadership development program in preparing promising library managers for directorship positions. It has been a highly effective collaboration with AAHSL, and we look forward to continued participation in the program.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The program is entering an unprecedented ninth year of identifying and developing the future leaders of academic health sciences libraries,&amp;#34; said AAHSL president Connie Poole. &amp;#34;The partnership with NLM has demonstrated its value as graduates assume directorships and other senior positions.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellows will have the opportunity to develop their knowledge and skills in a variety of learning settings, including exposure to leadership in another environment. They will be paired with mentors who are academic health sciences library directors. In addition to the individual relationship with their mentors, fellows benefit from working collaboratively with other fellows and mentors. Experienced program faculty and mentors will provide content and facilitation for the cohort. The program takes advantage of flexible scheduling and an online learning community to minimize disruption to professional and personal schedules. The sponsors will provide financial support for up to five fellows and will underwrite travel and meeting expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty fellows have participated in the program since its inauguration in 2002. To date, fifteen fellows have assumed director positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Because of the self-assessment and reflection I engaged in, I had a stronger picture of what I had to offer as a director,&amp;#34; said Teresa Knott, fellow, class of 2005-2006, and director at Virginia Commonwealth University. &amp;#34;The conversations-within our cohort, with my mentor, and with the people I met through the program-gave me the opportunity to consider issues facing the profession and the many facets of being a director.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heidi Heilemann, fellow, class of 2007-2008, and director at Stanford University, said, &amp;#34;The program provided me with invaluable access to a diverse and knowledgeable cohort of fellows and mentors. I plan to tap into the resource of a network of experts on a variety of topics from all over the country for many years to come. The program is robust and rich in many ways.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott Plutchak, mentor, classes of 2003-2004 and 2008-2009, and director at University of Alabama at Birmingham, stated, &amp;#34;What I have found so rewarding is that it puts me in a position to really think reflectively about what I&amp;#39;m doing and why-from very concrete decisions to more nebulous areas of motivation and leadership style. What I&amp;#39;ve gained from the program as a mentor has more than repaid the time and effort that I&amp;#39;ve put into it.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Program Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one-year program design is multi-faceted: three in-person leadership institutes; attendance at an Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) annual meeting; a yearlong fellow/mentor relationship; webinars and discussions on issues related to library leadership; and a two-week site visit to the mentor&amp;#39;s home library (in one or two-week segments).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program is designed to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduce fellows to leadership theory and practical tools for implementing change at organizational and professional levels;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduce fellows to critical issues facing academic health sciences libraries;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop meaningful professional relationships between fellows and mentors that give fellows access to career guidance and support;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expose fellows to another academic health sciences library and its institutional leadership under the guidance of their mentors;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examine career development and provide models of directors to fellows;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a cohort of leaders who will draw upon each other for support throughout their careers;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Promote diversity in the leadership of the profession; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Offer recognition to emerging leaders and enhance the competitive standing of fellows as they pursue director positions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM/AAHSL Leadership Fellows Program is currently accepting applications and nominations for the August 2, 2010, deadline for potential fellows for the 2010-2011 experience. Candidates for fellow should have a strong interest in pursuing a directorship in academic health sciences libraries, as well as a minimum of five years of department head level or higher responsibility, or equivalent experience, in an academic health sciences library, hospital library, or other library-related setting. Applications from qualified minority candidates are encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directors with at least five years&amp;#39; experience as director of an academic health sciences library should indicate preliminary interest in being matched as a mentor by contacting the AAHSL Future Leadership Committee by August 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program brochure, including information on program design, schedule, and application process, is available at &lt;a href="http://data.memberclicks.com/site/aahsl/NLM-AAHSL-Leadership-Fellows-Program-Application.pdf"&gt;http://data.memberclicks.com/site/aahsl/NLM-AAHSL-Leadership-Fellows-Program-Application.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about the program, please contact Carolyn Lipscomb, Program Manager, AAHSL Future Leadership Committee, &lt;a href="mailto:carolynlipscomb@cs.com"&gt;carolynlipscomb@cs.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and an arm of the National Institutes of Health, announces the addition of Hanaoka Seishu&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Surgical Casebook&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/flash/hanaoka/hanaoka.html"&gt;http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/flash/hanaoka/hanaoka.html&lt;/a&gt;) to its growing collection of virtual books and manuscripts available for thumbing through online via Turning the Pages (&lt;a href="http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/intro.htm"&gt;http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/intro.htm&lt;/a&gt;). The virtual volume is also available on kiosks in the Library&amp;#39;s Visitor Center (Building 38A, first floor) and the History of Medicine Division Reading Room (Building 38, first floor), and marks the continued collaboration of the Library&amp;#39;s Lister Hill Center and the History of Medicine Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newest addition to Turning the Pages is a magnificently illustrated manuscript depicting the likenesses of the men and women who came to Hanaoka for treatment in early 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century Japan. It is the first in the collection in which users will turn the pages according to Japanese custom, right to left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanaoka Seishu (1760-1835) was a pioneering Japanese surgeon who was the first to use general anesthesia to remove tumors from cancer patients. The images in the &lt;em&gt;Surgical Casebook&lt;/em&gt; are colorful, often charming, and depict quite graphically the medical and surgical problem to be treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanaoka studied both traditional Chinese-style medicine and Western-style surgical techniques. At age 25, he took over the family business and began to practice an eclectic style of medicine that combined these two traditions. He was greatly concerned with his inability to treat cancer patients, and over a period of 20 years he developed an herbal concoction he called &amp;#34;mafutsusan,&amp;#34; made up of several highly toxic plants. It did not include opium derivatives which European doctors were only beginning to identify as anesthetics. The narcotic effects of Hanaoka&amp;#39;s anesthetic could last as long as 24 hours, allowing him to surgically remove many different kinds of tumors which previously had been inoperable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Images from the manuscript were selected and curatorial text was written by Dr. Ann Jannetta, Professor Emerita of History at the University of Pittsburgh. The descriptive text can be viewed if one clicks the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; in the upper left corner of the virtual book page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image captions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top image:&lt;br /&gt;The daughter of a samurai warrior and a man from Yamato Province with tumors of the jaw, in Hanaoka Seishu&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Surgical Casebook&lt;/em&gt;, (Japan, ca. 1825).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom image:&lt;br /&gt;The surgeon Hanaoka Seishu performing surgery on an anesthetized male patient, in Hanaoka Seishu&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Surgical Casebook&lt;/em&gt;, (Japan, ca. 1825).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The daughter of a samurai warrior and a man from Yamato Province with tumors of the jaw." src="ttp_surgcasebk1.jpg" title="The daughter of a samurai warrior and a man from Yamato Province with tumors of the jaw." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The surgeon Hanaoka Seishu performing surgery on an anesthetized male patient." src="ttp_surgcasebk2.jpg" title="The surgeon Hanaoka Seishu performing surgery on an anesthetized male patient." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;PubMed (&lt;a href="http://www.pubmed.gov/"&gt;www.pubmed.gov&lt;/a&gt;), the National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s free online database of the world&amp;#39;s biomedical literature, recently attained a major milestone when the 20 millionth citation was added to the database. This occurred on July 27, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;That same day, coincidentally, PubMed Central (PMC) (&lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/"&gt;www.pubmedcentral.gov&lt;/a&gt;), the National Institutes of Health&amp;#39;s free digital archive for life sciences and biomedical literature, added its 2 millionth full-text article. PubMed Central was developed and is supported by the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;PubMed provides free access to MEDLINE, NLM&amp;#39;s database of citations and abstracts in the fields of medicine, nursing dentistry, veterinary medicine, health care systems and preclinical sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;PubMed was first released in January 1996 as an experimental database under the Entrez retrieval system, with full access to MEDLINE. The word &amp;#34;experimental&amp;#34; was dropped from the Web site in April 1997, and on June 26, 1997, a Capitol Hill press conference featuring Vice President Al Gore officially announced free MEDLINE access via PubMed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;In 1996, the last full year before the launch of PubMed, subscribers to the online version of MEDLINE conducted about 600,000 searches each month. When PubMed provided free access to MEDLINE, usage almost immediately tripled. Today, PubMed usage is approaching one billion searches annually.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;PubMed Central debuted in February 2000, providing free access to two journals. Today, PMC contains more than 650 journals which deposit their complete content, as well as some historic journal collections from the 1800s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Â &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The History of Medicine Division of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) is pleased to announce the release of its prototype History of Medicine Finding Aids Consortium (&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/consortium/index.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/consortium/index.html&lt;/a&gt;), a search-and-discovery tool for archival resources in the health sciences that are described by finding aids and held by various institutions throughout the United States. A finding aid is a tool created by archivists to give information about the contents of archival collections. Finding aids provide contextual information about collections oftentimes with detailed inventories to help researchers locate relevant materials. NLM is the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resource crawls existing Web content managed by several partner institutions, provides keyword search functionality, and provides results organized by holding institution. Links point to the holding institution&amp;#39;s Web sites. Formats indexed consist of HTML, PDF and Encoded Archival Description XML. The project does not include content held in bibliographic utilities or other database-type information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crawls are conducted monthly to ensure information is current and to capture new content as it is released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current Consortium partners are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/collections/archives/ammp/index.html"&gt;NLM History of Medicine Division, Archives and Modern Manuscripts Program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://library.cpmc.columbia.edu/hsl/archives/"&gt;Columbia University Health Center Library Archives and Special Collections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.medicalarchives.jhmi.edu/"&gt;Medical Archives of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.library.ucsf.edu/collections/archives"&gt;University of California-San Francisco Library Archives and Special Collections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/"&gt;University of Virginia Health Sciences Library Historical Collections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.library.vcu.edu/tml/speccoll/"&gt;Virginia Commonwealth University Tompkins-McCaw Library Special Collections and Archives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division invites libraries, archives and museums which include in their collections archival materials related to the history of medicine and health sciences to join.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more information about the project or requests to join the Consortium, please contact John P.

    <body>&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, is pleased to announce the donation of a large collection of printed books by and about the physician, poet, and cultural icon Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., MD. The collection was gathered by Washington-area bibliophile Marilyn Barth, former adjunct professor at the School of Library and Information Science at The Catholic University of America, Washington, DC. Among the books are over 100 colorful American and British editions of Holmes&amp;#39; bestselling and iconic work, &lt;em&gt;The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table&lt;/em&gt;, first published in 1858. Many of the books were on display in the Library&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division for Holmes&amp;#39;s 200&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809-1894) was a noted physician, lecturer, poet, novelist and the father of the Supreme Court Justice with the same name. Through his wit and turn of phrase, Holmes became an iconic figure in popular American culture, most notably through his poetry, his regular contributions to the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic Monthly&lt;/em&gt; magazine for over three decades, and his &lt;em&gt;Breakfast Table&lt;/em&gt; series of essays. His image and quotations from his works became ubiquitous, and he was one of the most sought after lecturers in America on topics ranging from medicine to literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Holmes&amp;#39; medical career began as a medical student in Paris and then at Harvard Medical School, and he quickly gained attention by winning two Boylston Prize Essays in 1836 and 1837. He is most known in medicine for his work, &lt;em&gt;The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever&lt;/em&gt; (1843), in which he challenged the medical establishment about its treatment of women during childbirth. He was professor of anatomy at Harvard for over 30 years and was an immensely influential figure in American medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;While Holmes Sr. is not as well-known today, his image and quotations from his works were used to sell countless commercial items in the late 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries, ranging from calendars and games to postcards and gift books. During his lifetime and for many years after his death his works, especially his poems and &lt;em&gt;The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table&lt;/em&gt;, were reprinted in hundreds of editions by American and British publishers. Today, many of Holmes&amp;#39; quotations are available online although many people now mistake his words for those of his son, the famous jurist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;In addition to the many copies of Holmes&amp;#39; &lt;em&gt;Autocrat&lt;/em&gt;, the collection features many editions of his poems and other writings, making it an important and interesting research collection relating to popular publishing practices of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. The collection includes colorful publishers&amp;#39; bindings, with some by important designers such as Sarah Wyman Whitman (1842-1904), best known for her work in the 1890s for Houghton, Mifflin &amp;#38; Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more information about the collection, contact Michael North, Head, Rare Books &amp;#38; Early Manuscripts, History of Medicine Division,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="mailto:northm@mail.nih.gov"&gt;&lt;em&gt;northm@mail.nih.gov&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For information about donating historical materials to NLM, please visit our Web site:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/about/donate.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/about/donate.html&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border="0"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Autocrat of the Breakfast Table" border="0" height="339" hspace="10" src="/news//autocrat-dogwoodflower.jpg" width="250" /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Holmes, Oliver Wendell, Sr. &lt;em&gt;The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table.&lt;/em&gt; Mayflower series.

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;New Online Resource is Latest to Showcase Large Collection of Chinese Public Health Posters at NLM&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new Web site featuring Chinese anti-tuberculosis posters has been launched by the National Library of Medicine (NLM), the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health. Titled, &amp;#34;Ã§ÂÂ¨Ã§ÂÂ - Consumptive Disease: Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Posters, 1950-1980,&amp;#34; the site is at: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/chineseantitb/index.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/chineseantitb/index.html&lt;/a&gt;. NLM owns what is thought to be the largest collection of Chinese public health posters outside of China.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exhibit features 62 anti-tuberculosis posters that showcase Chinese campaigns to combat this debilitating disease. From 1950 through 1980, the Chinese government, working with the Anti-TB Association and the Red Cross, launched anti-tuberculosis campaigns as part of the national public health movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These posters emphasize key preventive methods such as using BCG (Bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin) vaccines and eliminating public spitting, along with attention to good nutrition, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle. Â Anti-tuberculosis posters were an important tool in disseminating health knowledge. The campaigns, along with the universal free healthcare, led to a significant decline of tuberculosis by the 1980s. However, the disease resurged since the 1990s under the pressures of rapid industrialization and urbanization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online exhibit is curated by Professor Liping Bu, PhD, of Alma College, in Alma, Michigan, a visiting scholar in the Library&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division. It joins a number of online exhibits based on the Library&amp;#39;s collection of 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century Chinese public health materials. These include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#34;Health for the People: Continuity and Change in Asian Medicine&amp;#34;- http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/healthforthepeople/index.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#34;Chinese Anti-Malaria Posters&amp;#34;- http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/chineseantimalaria/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#34;Chinese Public Health Posters&amp;#34;- http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/chineseposters/index.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For further information, please contact Dr. Liping Bu at bulipi@alma.edu; Dr. Paul Theerman, Head of Images and Archives, at Paul.Theerman@nih.gov; or Ms. Ginny Roth, Curator of Prints and Photographs, at &lt;a href="mailto:Ginny.Roth@nih.gov"&gt;Ginny.Roth@nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Poster from anti-TB collection" src="/news/tb_poster.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A poster from the anti-TB collection, &lt;/em&gt;&amp;#34;To Prevent Tuberculosis,We Must Have X-Rays Regularly.&amp;#34; &lt;em&gt;Beijing Tuberculosis Prevention &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institute and the Tuberculosis Prevention Institute of the East District &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;of Beijing, n.d., ca. 1980.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ã©ÂÂ²Ã¨ÂÂºÃ§Â»ÂÃ¦Â Â¸, Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ¥Â®ÂÃ¦ÂÂÃ¨Â¿ÂÃ¨Â¡ÂÃ¨ÂÂºÃ©ÂÂ¨Ã©ÂÂ&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM), the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, has launched a new digital repository, Digital Collections, at &lt;a href="http://collections.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://collections.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;. This new resource is complementary to the PubMed Central digital archive of electronic journal articles (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/&lt;/a&gt;). The repository allows rich searching, browsing and retrieval of monographs and films from NLM&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division. Additional content and other format types will be added over time. Users can perform full-text and keyword searching within each collection or across the entire repository.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&amp;#34;The new Digital Collections repository will allow NLM to provide permanent, robust access to an even broader range of biomedical information,&amp;#34; said Betsy Humphreys, Deputy Director, NLM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessing the Collections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;This first release of Digital Collections includes a newly expanded set of Cholera Online monographs, a portion of which NLM first published online in PDF format in 2007. The version of Cholera Online now available via Digital Collections includes 518 books (dating from 1817 to 1900) about cholera pandemics of that period. More information about the selection of the books and the subject of cholera may be found on the original Cholera Online Web page at: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/cholera/"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/cholera/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;Each book was scanned into high-quality TIFF images, which underwent optical character recognition to generate corresponding text files. Finally, a JPEG2000 derivative was created for each page for presentation through the integrated book viewer, which includes a Flash-based zooming feature for resizing and rotating a page on demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Book viewer showing zooming of a page image" src="/news/digital_col_DC_TB2.jpg" title="Zooming of Page Image" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Book Viewer Showing Arbitrary Zooming of a Page Image&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;The second collection is a selection of 11 historical films, all created by the US government and in the public domain. The films have been digitized in a variety of video formats, to accommodate a wide range of playback devices, including mobile devices. Digital Collections also includes an integrated, Flash-based video player which allows full-text search of a film&amp;#39;s transcript and graphically displays where the searched word or phrase occurs within the timeline of the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Video player showing search hits" src="/news/digical_col_dentures_tb_article.jpg" title="Video player" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Video Player Showing Search Hits in a Graphical Timeline of the Film&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preserving the Collections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Every page of each book and every video is stored as a discrete object in Digital Collections, with an XML &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; describing each object and relationships between objects. To ensure long-term integrity of these digital files, checksums (number strings which act like mathematical &amp;#34;fingerprints&amp;#34;) are calculated and written into the objects as the objects are ingested into Digital Collections. These checksums will be re-calculated periodically and compared with the original values. Additionally, all ingested files are versioned, so that any changes do not overwrite the original but instead create a new, second file which is stored along with the first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Digital Collections was built using several open-source components, with the Fedora Commons Repository Software providing the foundation. The primary browse and search interface has been adapted from the Muradora &amp;#34;front-end&amp;#34; for Fedora, created by Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia. The book viewer is a component of Northwestern University&amp;#39;s Book Workflow Interface, also created specifically for use with Fedora. Los Alamos National Laboratory&amp;#39;s djatoka JPEG2000 server handles the images. The video player was adapted from a research project by NLM&amp;#39;s Office of Computer and Communications Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;In 2009, NLM began a pilot project to build the repository, develop appropriate workflows for ingesting and managing the content, and provide a core set of end-user services suitable for general public access. Information on the year-long evaluation process leading to the selection of Fedora can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/digitalrepository/index.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/digitalrepository/index.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please send your comments and questions about Digital Collections to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://apps.nlm.nih.gov/mainweb/siebel/nlm/index.cfm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NLM Customer Service&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;New NLM Exhibition Focuses on the Contributions of African-American Surgeons and Nurses during the Civil War&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many histories have been written about medical care during the American Civil War, but the participation and contributions of African Americans as nurses, surgeons and hospital workers have often been overlooked. Opening Friday, October 1, 2010 at the National Library of Medicine, a special display, &lt;em&gt;Binding Wounds, Pushing Boundaries: African Americans in Civil War Medicine&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;looks at these men and women, and how their service as medical providers challenged the prescribed notions of race and gender pushing the boundaries of the role of African Americans in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Binding Wounds, Pushing Boundaries&lt;/em&gt; will be displayed in the first floor lobby and History of Medicine Division (HMD) Reading Room of the main National Library of Medicine (Building 38), on the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda, Maryland, through February 28, 2011. The Library is open 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM weekdays (except Federal holidays) and 8:30 AM to 2:00 PM Saturdays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through historical images and never-before-seen Civil War era documents, &lt;em&gt;Binding Wounds&lt;/em&gt; explores the life and experiences of surgeons Alexander T. Augusta and Anderson R. Abbott, and nurses Susie King Taylor and Ann Stokes as they provided medical care to soldiers and civilians while participating in the fight for freedom. &amp;#34;This exhibition opens the door to this rarely studied part of history and brings a voice to those that have remained silent for nearly 150 years,&amp;#34; says curator Jill L. Newmark of the History of Medicine Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online version of the exhibition launches October 1, at: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/bindingwounds"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/bindingwounds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traveling banner version of the exhibition will begin touring the United States in October 2010.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;A new website, &lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;Most Horrible &amp;#38; Shocking Murders: Murder pamphlets in the collection of the National Library of Medicine,&amp;#34;&lt;/em&gt; has been launched by the National Library of Medicine (NLM), the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library. The site features a selection of murder pamphlets from the late 1600s to the late 1800s-from a treasure trove of several hundred owned by the Library.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since the invention of movable type in the mid-1400s, public appetite for tales of shocking murders-&amp;#34;true crime&amp;#34;-has been one of the most durable facts of the market for printed material. For more than five centuries, murder pamphlets have been hawked on street corners, town squares, taverns, coffeehouses, news stands, and bookshops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These pamphlets have been a rich source for historians of medicine, crime novelists, and cultural historians, who mine them for evidence to illuminate the history of class, gender, race, the law, the city, crime, religion and other topics. The murder pamphlets in the NLM&amp;#39;s collection address cases connected to forensic medicine, especially cases in which doctors were accused of committing-or were the victims of-murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The website (&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/murderpamphlets/index.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/murderpamphlets/index.html&lt;/a&gt;), based on a 2008 exhibition at the NLM, is curated by Michael Sappol, PhD, historian in the NLM&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Phamphlet Cover Image" src="/news/elmcitycovert.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This pamphlet tells the story of the 1881 discovery of the body of Jennie Cramer, a 20-year-old society girl, by fishermen along the Connecticut shore.Â  While it was initially believed she had committed suicide by drowning, an autopsy showed there was no water in her lungs, and that she had been raped and poisoned.Â  The author of the pamphlet tells about the arrest of the accused, the three-month trial, and the jury&amp;#39;s verdict.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Lithograph" src="/news/mpbanner.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This pamphlet suggests a scenario of how Priscilla Budge, wife of the Reverend Henry Budge, might have been murdered. Reverend Budge is shown placing his hand over the mouth of his wife lying in bed, and slitting her throat from the left side. The case was tried at the Oneida, New York, Circuit Court, in August and September, 1861, and the judge&amp;#39;s charge in the civil action was tried at the Herkimer Circuit in October and November, 1861.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/murderpamphlets/index.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="left" alt="Thomas P. Detre" border="0" height="211" src="/news/detre_pittsburgh.jpg" style="margin:0 10px 10px 0" width="205" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Thomas P. Detre&lt;/strong&gt;, 86, an active supporter of the National Library of Medicine and an engaged and visionary member of its governing Board of Regents, died at home October 9 after a long illness. Dr. Detre was an academic leader whose ambition and determined efforts helped propel the University of Pittsburgh&amp;#39;s schools of the health sciences to international prominence.Â  He was the architect behind the transformation of the University&amp;#39;s teaching hospitals into UPMC, an integrated global health enterprise. During Dr. Detre&amp;#39;s tenure as the University of Pittsburgh&amp;#39;s senior vice chancellor for the health sciences, he established an innovative funding cycle of driving dollars from clinical practice into interdisciplinary research and then applying the results of those endeavors to clinical advances. This approach attracted more patients and led to the growth of the University&amp;#39;s medical arm and the ultimate realization of what is now UPMC, and it positioned the University to become one of the nation&amp;#39;s top 10 recipients of research support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a status it has maintained since 1997.Â  Since 2004, he had held the titles of Emeritus Distinguished Senior Vice Chancellor for the Health Sciences and Emeritus Distinguished Service Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Detre was a member of the NLM Board of Regents from 2002 to 2005 and chaired that body from 2005 to 2006. Â Â He was a consultant to the Board from 2006 to present.Â  Dr. Detre served on the NLM Board as it received input from panels of outside advisers and developed the recommendations in &lt;em&gt;Charting the Course for the 21st Century: NLM&amp;#39;s Long Range Plan 2006-2016. &lt;/em&gt;His tenure as Chair coincided with the initial voluntary implementation of the NIH Public Access Policy.Â  He also chaired the Board&amp;#39;s special NIH Public Access Policy Working Group, which was established in consultation with then NIH Director Elias Zerhouni, to review evidence of compliance with the voluntary policy and assess its effectiveness.Â  Dr. Zerhouni commented that Dr. Detre&amp;#39;s expertise in psychiatry might be a particularly appropriate qualification for the assignment, given the range and strong opinions represented on the Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Tom Detre was an outstanding clinician and researcher, and a legendary academic leader.Â  NLM was privileged to benefit from his vision, wide knowledge, sharp insight, and clarity of expression,&amp;#34; said Donald A. B. Lindberg, NLM Director.Â  &amp;#34;He will be remembered for his exceptional charm, wit, and kindness, and also for his many professional achievements. He was notoriously always ready for an e-mail exchange of uproarious and irreverent stories. He treated NLM more or less as his patient. He repeatedly praised its goals and accomplishments, but he repeatedly chastised us for not having made these better known throughout the land. Once he personally supervised the writing (and re-writing) of an easy-to-understand, one page summary of NLM programs! This determination and his consistent concern for the personal problems of many NLM people makes him impossible to forget.&amp;#34;Â  Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Detre was born Tamas Feldmeier on May 17, 1924, in Budapest, Hungary, and decided to become a psychiatrist when he was 14. He was a 20-year-old student when he found out that his parents and 20 other relatives had been killed at Auschwitz. The following year, he renamed himself &amp;#34;Detre,&amp;#34; a play on the French verb that means &amp;#34;to be,&amp;#34; as a symbol of his will to continue living.Â  He received a bachelor&amp;#39;s degree in classical languages from the Gymnasium of Piarist Fathers in Kecskemet, Hungary in 1942, and completed his medical degree at the University of Rome School of Medicine in 1952. He interned at Morrisania City Hospital in New York, and trained in psychiatry at Mt. Sinai Hospital, New York, and Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. He held clinical and academic appointments at Yale-New Haven Hospital and had been psychiatrist-in-chief there from 1968 to 1973, when he moved to Pittsburgh with his first wife, renowned epidemiologist Katherine M. Detre, MD, DrPH. She died in January 2006, almost 50 years after they married.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to his numerous administrative accomplishments, Dr. Detre was a member of more than 20 medical societies and authored or co-authored scientific papers, textbook chapters and a well-recognized book on psychiatric treatment. He served on a variety of advisory boards for the National Institutes of Health, including NLM&amp;#39;s, the US Food and Drug Administration and the US Department of Veterans Affairs; served as president of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology; and was active on numerous committees and task forces for various agencies, organizations and philanthropies.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Detre also was the recipient of many professional honors. Â He was elected a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences in 1998, received an honorary medical degree from Semmelweis University, Budapest, in 2003, and wasÂ  awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree by Carnegie Mellon University in 2009. In 2000, the University of Pittsburgh named the WPIC building Thomas Detre Hall in his honor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Detre is survived by his second wife, Ellen Ormond, PhD, of Point Breeze, Pennsylvania, sons John A. Detre, MD, of Philadelphia, and Antony J. Detre, of New York City, and four grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The National Library of Medicine is the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;#Â  #Â  #&lt;/p&gt;

The Disaster Information Management Research Center (DIMRC) Web pages (&lt;a href="http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;) have a new look, as does the site for the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) Emergency Preparedness &amp;#38; Response Toolkit, at &lt;a href="http://nnlm.gov/ep"&gt;http://nnlm.gov/ep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DIMRC redesign enhances access to NLM&amp;#39;s many diverse resources, which are useful for disaster and emergency readiness, response, and recovery. Emergency responders will find links to the Wireless Information System for Emergency Responders (WISER) resource for hazardous materials incidents and the Radiation Emergency Medical Management (REMM) site. A growing list of guides to online disaster information includes titles such as &amp;#34;Crude Oil Spills and Health,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Special Populations: Emergency and Disaster Preparedness,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Floods.&amp;#34; New features include an A to Z Index, links to the latest articles and reports from PubMed and the Resource Guide for Public Health Preparedness, and news about disaster events, publications, and online resources from both US and international sources. The Center is a part of the Specialized Information Services Division at NLM.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site now features a cleaner presentation of information and resources, plus Twitter feeds and easier access to weather-related alerts and warnings. A new video tutorial (&lt;a href="http://nnlm.gov/ep/toolkit-navigation-video"&gt;http://nnlm.gov/ep/toolkit-navigation-video&lt;/a&gt;) assists users in navigating the toolkit. The National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) (&lt;a href="http://nnlm.gov/"&gt;http://nnlm.gov&lt;/a&gt;) provides the Toolkit for librarians to use in developing emergency preparedness and response plans for their libraries and finding help with handling floods, fires and other incidents that affect a library&amp;#39;s buildings, collections and services. The National Network, a service of the National Library of Medicine, coordinates eight regional offices and a network of nearly 6,000 member libraries in the United States. The Toolkit Web site is managed by the University of Virginia Claude Moore Health Sciences Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;img alt="DIMRC Web Page" src="/news/dimrc_refresh.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Toolkit Web Page" src="/news/NNLM-EP-Toolkit.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;In keeping with its mission to provide reliable health information to consumers, the National Library of Medicine announces the debut of MedlinePlus Connect (&lt;a href="http://medlineplus.gov/connect"&gt;http://medlineplus.gov/connect&lt;/a&gt;), a free service that allows electronic health record (EHR) systems to link users to MedlinePlus. MedlinePlus is an authoritative up-to-date health information resource for patients, families and health care providers, and delivers information about conditions and disorders, medications, and health and wellness. MedlinePlus has hundreds of health topic pages that bring together information from the National Institutes of Health, other US government agencies and authoritative health information providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MedlinePlus Connect accepts requests from EHRs based on diagnoses (problem codes) and medications. NLM has mapped MedlinePlus health topics to two standard diagnostic coding systems used in EHRs. When any EHR submits a request to MedlinePlus Connect, the service returns the closest matching health topic(s) as a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For problem code requests, MedlinePlus Connect supports:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cms.gov/ICD9ProviderDiagnosticCodes/01_overview.asp"&gt;ICD-9-CM&lt;/a&gt; (International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition, Clinical Modification)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/core_subset.html"&gt;SNOMED CT CORE Problem List Subset&lt;/a&gt; (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine, Clinical Terms, CORE Problem List Subset) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;MedlinePlus Connect also links any EHR system to drug information written especially for patients. EHR systems can send MedlinePlus Connect a request for a medication code, and the service will return link(s) to the most appropriate drug information. &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginformation.html"&gt;MedlinePlus drug information&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;AHFSÂ® Consumer Medication Information&lt;/em&gt; and is licensed for use on MedlinePlus from the &lt;a href="http://www.ashp.org"&gt;American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, ASHP, Inc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For medication requests, MedlinePlus Connect supports:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/"&gt;RXCUI&lt;/a&gt; (RxNorm Concept Unique Identifier)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ndc/default.cfm"&gt;National Drug Code&lt;/a&gt; (NDC) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The API for using this service conforms to the HL7 Context-Aware Knowledge Retrieval (Infobutton) Knowledge Request URL-Based Implementation specification which you can download from this page, &lt;a href="http://www.hl7.org/dstucomments/index_expired.cfm"&gt;http://www.hl7.org/dstucomments/index_expired.cfm&lt;/a&gt;. NLM is working on adding laboratory test responses to MedlinePlus Connect. We will also support an XML-based Web service at a future date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General information is available on the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/connect/overview.html"&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt; page. For the technical how-to&amp;#39;s, see the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/connect/technical.html"&gt;technical&lt;/a&gt; details page. To stay up-to-date on developments with MedlinePlus Connect or to talk to other organizations that are using it, join NLM&amp;#39;s free &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/connect/emaillist.html"&gt;email list&lt;/a&gt;.

    <body>&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;Â &lt;img alt="" src="/news/frankenstein-exhibition-logo.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, has enriched its popular online exhibition, &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/frankenstein/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frankenstein: Penetrating the Secrets of Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/frankenstein"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/frankenstein&lt;/a&gt;), with new educational resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched as a physical exhibition at NLM in 1997, &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt; still consistently ranks in the top 10 of the Library&amp;#39;s online exhibitions. It looks at the world of Mary Shelley, who wrote the legendary &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt; novel, and examines the story&amp;#39;s influence on popular culture and its illumination of the blurred, uncertain boundaries of &amp;#34;acceptable&amp;#34; science. The exhibition offers education resources under two new sections, &amp;#34;Higher Education Module&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Lesson Plans:&amp;#34;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/frankenstein/education/highereducation.html"&gt;&amp;#34;Higher Education Module&amp;#34; section&lt;/a&gt; features &lt;em&gt;The Following Frankenstein: Mary Shelley, the Monster, and Medical Science&lt;/em&gt;, authored by Susan E. Lederer, PhD, Robert Turell Professor of the History of Medicine and Bioethics at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/frankenstein/education/lessonplans.html"&gt;&amp;#34;Lesson Plans&amp;#34; section&lt;/a&gt; presents &lt;em&gt;Electricity, Frankenstein, and the Spark of Life &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s Alive!&amp;#34;: Frankenstein and the Limits of Medical Research&lt;/em&gt;, middle- and high-school lesson plans respectively. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These education resources provide instructional templates that present and use exhibition materials to engage students&amp;#39; interest in and foster their analysis of the enduring Frankenstein myth and metaphor with historical and scientific perspectives. Educators are welcome to review and use the module or lesson plans in whole or in part, as appropriate for their students&amp;#39; interests, levels and academic goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;# # #&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;New Web Interface Allows Easier Searching of Text and Audio Content&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division is pleased to announce the release of a new Web interface (&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/manuscripts/oh.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/manuscripts/oh.html&lt;/a&gt;) to its oral history collections, as part of its growing electronic texts program. Content includes digital editions of transcripts and any accompanying audio content when feasible. Users can browse content by title, interviewee name, and subject. Full-text searching is available across all sub-collections, across each sub-collection, and within each transcript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently the site contains 107 interviews in two sub-collections consisting of over 13,000 pages and 80 hours of audio content. These interviews represent the majority of HMD&amp;#39;s oral histories conducted by HMD staff during the 1960s when HMD had an active oral history program. HMD still conducts the occasional interview for specific projects, but the majority of our post-1970 holdings consist of interviews that are the product of external researchers or practitioners, or in our capacity as the service point for programs such as that of the Food and Drug Administration History Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the topics covered include: the development of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine by &amp;#34;Big Four&amp;#34; members including influential surgeon William Halsted and renowned gynecologist Howard Kelly; Guy Tugwell and George Larrick discussing their roles in the 1938 and 1951 revisions to the Pure Food and Drug Act; the practice of surgery in the United States; and medical economics in the 1930s. There is also a series of 13 interviews with homeopathy physicians, conducted in 1968. There is a separate sub-collection of interviews with primary care physicians (internists) conducted by Fitzhugh Mullan in the 1990s as part of research conducted for his book, &lt;em&gt;Big Doctoring in America: Profiles in Primary Care&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can also hear Vivien Thomas, the celebrated African American surgical technician, speak about working with surgeon Alfred Blalock to develop procedures to treat blue baby syndrome, US Senator Lister Hill (a key figure in the creation and passage of the National Library of Medicine Act of 1956) discussing his family, life as a politician, and health care legislation, and a short recording of celebrated English nurse Florence Nightingale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future content will include interviews conducted as part of NICHSR&amp;#39;s History of Health Services Research project, oral histories from the FDA&amp;#39;s active oral history program, and the Medical Library Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcripts are marked up following the Text Encoding Initiative&amp;#39;s (TEI) XML encoding level 1 parameters. Audio content is delivered via a custom Flash player and is downloadable as an MP3. Archival WAV files are available upon request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library, is a component of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h4&gt;Pre-1917 Collection Includes Pamphlets and Dissertations on Spectrum of Medical Topics, Including Some by Future Nobel Laureates&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The History of Medicine Division of the National Library of Medicine is pleased to announce the completion of a five-year project to catalog its Imperial Russian Era (pre-1917) collection of 5,000 pamphlets and dissertations for degrees in medicine, pharmacy and veterinary science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core of the NLM collection is over 3,000 medical dissertations submitted to the Imperial Medical-Chirurgical Academy (later, the Imperial Military Medical Academy) in St. Petersburg. Dating from 1849 to 1915, they comprise the most complete run known to exist outside of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, the dissertations present the results of clinical medical research and reflect the common Nineteenth Century concerns of epidemic and war, and changing ideas of hygiene and health care. Pharmacological works investigated the therapeutic effects of drugs and veterinary treatises focused on the diseases of dogs, horses and livestock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dissertations became a requirement for medical degrees in 1858, during the widespread medical education reforms that resulted from the defeat of the Imperial Russian Army in the Crimean War (1853-1856). Rampant disease among the troops, rather than actual combat, produced exceedingly high numbers of casualties. Military officials blamed the high mortality rate, and the loss of the war, on the scarcity of military physicians and the poor quality of their training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Academy eventually produced a Nobel Laureate. In 1883, Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1849-1936) wrote his doctoral thesis on the centrifugal nerves of the heart. His general observations of the physiology of the nervous system laid the groundwork for his later investigations into the role of the nervous system in digestion, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1904.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1870s, the Academy agreed to admit women, due to a military need for female physicians to treat the wives of Muslim Bashkir troops. Syphilis was widespread and, for religious reasons, the women could not be seen by male practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Varvara Kashevarova-Rudneva (1844?-1899) became the AcademyÃ¢ÂÂs first female graduate in 1876. A certified midwife, she wrote her dissertation on the pathology of the vagina, and published the first description of vaginal sarcoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pamphlets in the NLM collection cover a wide variety of medical topics, including works on alcoholism, anatomy, cholera, cultured milk products, mental or neurological disorders, metabolism, public hygiene, syphilis and tuberculosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oldest item is an 1829 illustrated case report of a congenital heart defect by the eminent Russian anatomist and surgeon, Ilya Vasilevich Buyalski (1789-1866). Credited with being the first Russian surgeon to use anesthesia, Buyalski also invented several surgical instruments and developed an embalming technique to preserve anatomical specimens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1906, Ilia Metchnikov (1845-1916) wrote a pamphlet entitled &lt;em&gt;On Yogurt&lt;/em&gt;, which described his observation that yogurt was beneficial for maintaining a proper bacterial balance in the intestines. MetchnikovÃ¢ÂÂs pioneering recommendation that yogurt be added to oneÃ¢ÂÂs daily diet to promote a healthy immune system is a mainstay of modern probiotic diets. In 1908 Metchnikov was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his work on the role of phagocytes in the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The struggles and triumphs of 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century women physicians are vividly described in Ekaterina SlanskaiaÃ¢ÂÂs (1853-1904?) 1894 memoir, &lt;em&gt;House Calls: A Day in the Practice of a Duma Woman Doctor in St. Petersburg&lt;/em&gt;, published posthumously in 1904. Female medical graduates were generally hired by cities to attend to the health problems of the lower classes. Cities preferred to hire women, in part, because they would work for lower salaries, and because they were thought to be more effective with women and children, who were often too modest or too scared to seek help from male medical professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pamphlets and dissertations complement the NLM collection of 2,000 book-length monographs from the Imperial Russian Era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the cataloging project, bibliographic records were created by contract staff from VNS Group in NLMÃ¢ÂÂs online catalogue, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=nlmcatalog"&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=nlmcatalog&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://locatorplusv2.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;#38;PAGE=First"&gt;http://locatorplusv2.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;#38;PAGE=First&lt;/a&gt;, and distributed to licensees of NLM bibliographic data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Portrait of Ivan Petrovich Pavlov" border="1" src="/news/Imperial-Russia.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clockwise from upper left: Portrait of Ivan Petrovich Pavlov; cover, in Russian, of PavlovÃ¢ÂÂs doctoral dissertation entitled, &lt;/em&gt;On the Centrifugal Nerves of the Heart&lt;em&gt;; portrait of Ilia Metchnikov; title page, in Russian, of MetchnikovÃ¢ÂÂs pamphlet entitled, &lt;/em&gt;On Yogurt&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The National Library of Medicine, a component of the National Institutes of Health, is the worldÃ¢ÂÂs largest medical library.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;The National Library of Medicine, a component of the National Institutes of Health, in collaboration with the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center at Howard University, announces the release of an extensive selection from the papers of African-American surgeon Charles R. Drew (1904-1950), who organized and directed America&amp;#39;s first large-scale blood bank during the early years of World War II, on the Library&amp;#39;s Profiles in ScienceÂ® Web site (&lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;With this addition, the number of prominent researchers, public health officials and promoters of medical research whose personal and professional records are presented on Profiles has grown to 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;&amp;#34;Dr. Drew&amp;#39;s blood bank work resolved numerous problems in transfusion medicine in that era, helping to make blood supplies readily available for wartime use. But he was also a surgeon who transformed surgical education at Howard, and forged a tradition of excellence,&amp;#34; said Donald A.B. Lindberg, MD, director of the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;Dr. Charles Drew was born and raised in Washington, DC, where he attended the best of the city&amp;#39;s African-American schools. Although he was only an average student, his outstanding athletic performance at Dunbar High School earned him a scholarship to Amherst College, where he became a football and track legend. He received his AB in 1926 and, inspired to pursue a medical career, worked two years as an athletic director and biology instructor at Baltimore&amp;#39;s Morgan College to earn money for medical school. At the McGill University College of Medicine in MontrÃ©al, Canada, he became a star student and, once again, a star athlete, winning Canadian championships in several sports. He received his MD and CM (Master of Surgery) in 1933, graduating third in a class of 137. During his internship and residency at MontrÃ©al General Hospital, he explored blood transfusion and other fluid replacement treatments for shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;Several years after joining the surgical faculty at the historically black Howard University College of Medicine in Washington in 1935, Drew received a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship to train with eminent surgeon Allen O. Whipple at New York&amp;#39;s Presbyterian Hospital. He also took this opportunity to earn a doctorate in medical science from Columbia University. At Presbyterian, he worked with Dr. John Scudder on studies relating to treating shock, fluid balance, blood chemistry and preservation, and transfusion. His dissertation project was establishing an experimental blood bank at Presbyterian, which opened in August 1939. In June 1940, Drew received his doctorate in Science in Medicine from Columbia, becoming the first African American to earn the degree there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;&amp;#34;Blood for Britain,&amp;#34; a plasma collection project initiated early in 1940 by New York hospitals and the Red Cross to aid England during World War II, quickly established Drew as a blood bank pioneer. Although others had developed the basic methods for plasma use, Drew played a key role in planning the project and, as medical director, instituted uniform procedures and standards for collecting blood and processing plasma at the participating hospitals. In January 1941, Drew became the assistant director of a pilot program for a national blood banking system, jointly sponsored by the National Research Council and the American Red Cross. The success of the subsequent nationwide project was tarnished by the Armed Forces&amp;#39; initial exclusion of African-American donors, and later their segregation of blood donations. Throughout the war, Drew criticized these policies as unscientific and insulting to African-American citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;Drew returned to Howard University in April 1941 and soon became chair of the Department of Surgery and Chief of Surgery at Freedmen&amp;#39;s Hospital. For the next nine years he devoted himself to training young African-American surgeons who would meet or exceed the most rigorous specialty standards, and would, in turn, continue the tradition of excellence at Howard and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;Drew died on April 1, 1950, in Burlington, North Carolina, from injuries sustained in a car accident while en route to a conference. Despite the prompt and competent care he received from the physicians at a nearby hospital, he was too badly injured to survive. Drew&amp;#39;s tragic death generated a persistent myth that he died because he was denied admission to a &amp;#34;whites-only&amp;#34; hospital. His colleagues, including those present at the time, and his family have said that this was untrue. The white doctors tried, but failed, to save Drew&amp;#39;s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;Profiles in Science features digitized correspondence, published articles, notebook excerpts, drafts of reports, and photographs from the Charles R. Drew Papers at the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center at Howard University. Visitors to the site can view, for example, Drew&amp;#39;s letters to his family and professional colleagues, drafts of blood banking protocols, and correspondence protesting the military&amp;#39;s policy of segregating blood donations. The site also includes Drew&amp;#39;s never-published 1940 doctoral dissertation, &amp;#34;Banked Blood,&amp;#34; and numerous photographs documenting his life and career. Of particular note, Drew&amp;#39;s letters to his wife reveal the stresses of carving out a career in segregated American medicine, while also trying to fulfill the roles of husband and father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Dr. Charles Drew." height="260" src="/news/charles_drew.jpg" width="217" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Dr. Charles Drew, around 1949, courtesy of Moorland-Spingarn Research Center.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Located in Bethesda, Maryland, the National Library of Medicine is the world&amp;#39;s largest library of the health sciences.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, announces the release of a new Turning the Pages virtual book on its Web site (&lt;a href="http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/books.htm"&gt;http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/books.htm&lt;/a&gt;), as well as in kiosks at NLM. The new book is the &lt;em&gt;Kitab Aja&amp;#39;ib al-makhluqat wa Gharaib al-Mawjudat&lt;/em&gt;, literally &amp;#34;The Wonders of Creation,&amp;#34; compiled in the middle 1200s in what is now Iran or Iraq. The vibrantly illustrated work is considered one of the most important natural history texts of the medieval Islamic world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author, Abu Yahya Zakariya ibn Muhammad ibn Mahmud-al-Qazwini (ca. 1203-1283 CE), is known simply as al-Qazwini. One of the most noted natural historians, geographers and encyclopedists of the period, he was born in the city of Qazwin in Persia and received much of his education in Baghdad, the cultural center of the region. Al-Qazwini wrote most of his works in Arabic. This beautifully illustrated Persian translation was created in 1537 in the Mughal Empire, corresponding to what is now Pakistan and northern India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The Wonders of Creation&amp;#34; is divided into two sections, focusing respectively on celestial phenomena, including the planets, stars, and angels, and the terrestrial world, including geography, ethnography, zoology, and botany. Al-Qazwini was primarily a compiler of information from different authors, both ancient and medieval, and made few original observations of his own. However, his flowing and understandable writing style and thoroughness on different topics made his texts popular and often quoted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manuscript copy itself consists of 335 leaves of paper with more than 150 illustrations, in opaque watercolors and ink, of constellations, mythical figures, and various plants and animals placed throughout the text. The Web exhibition contains a selection of these pages, accompanied by explanatory text. Â The text is viewable by clicking the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; in the upper left corner of the virtual book page.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Launched at NLM in 2001, Turning the Pages is part of a continuing collaboration between the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications and the History of Medicine Division. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt="Map of World" src="/news/qaz_1.gif" /&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Map of the world showing Africa, Asia and the Indian Ocean, ca. 1280 CE, in ZakarÃÂ«yÃÂ&amp;#39; ibn Muhammad al-Qazwini&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;Wonders of Creation,&amp;#34; from Manuscript P 1 of the US National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s Turning the Pages project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Screen shot of Turning The Pages Book" src="/news/qaz_2.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning the Pages in motion from ZakarÃÂ«yÃÂ&amp;#39; ibn Muhammad al-Qazwini&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;Wonders of Creation,&amp;#34; featuring Manuscript P 1 of the US National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Screen Shot of Turning The Pages book" src="/news/qaz_3.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Simurg, or Phoenix, and peacock in ZakarÃÂ«yÃÂ&amp;#39; ibn Muhammad al-Qazwini&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;Wonders of Creation,&amp;#34; from Manuscript P 1 of the US National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s Turning the Pages project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;A new policy permitting worldwide free access to SNOMED CT preferred names and concept identifiers will bolster current US efforts to use quality performance measurement as a key driver for advancing interoperable exchange of health data, as required by the Meaningful Use provisions of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act. The policy supports free distribution and use of SNOMED CT terms in measure specifications that would be both human-readable and machine-readable, thereby facilitating broad stakeholder consideration and review of these critical performance metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opportunity for free Ã¢ÂÂpublic goodÃ¢ÂÂ use of SNOMED CT was announced in late January 2011, by the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation (IHTSDO), the international body responsible for SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of MEDicine--Clinical Terms). (For more details, see the IHTSDO press release at &lt;a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Docs_01/Press_Releases/20112701-IHTSDO-NLM-press.pdf"&gt;http://www.ihtsdo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Docs_01/Press_Releases/20112701-IHTSDO-NLM-press.pdf&lt;/a&gt;). SNOMED CT is owned and distributed by the IHTSDO, a non-profit multi-national organization based in Denmark. The U.S. participates in IHTSDO through the National Library of Medicine, which is the US Member to the group and national distribution center for the terminology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reaction to the new policy has been strongly positive from the health data standards and quality measure development communities. Floyd Eisenberg, MD, Senior Vice President for Health Information Technology at National Quality Forum (NQF), expressed his Ã¢ÂÂdelightÃ¢ÂÂ that Ã¢ÂÂmeasure developers would be able to distribute SNOMED CT preferred terms and concept IDs in measure specifications, further providing the breadth of expression available in SNOMED CT into clinical care workflow.Ã¢ÂÂ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Douglas Fridsma, MD, Ph.D, Director of ONCÃ¢ÂÂs Office of Standards and Interoperability, commented that Ã¢ÂÂIn addition to its beneficial effect on the definition of quality measures, the SNOMED CT Ã¢ÂÂpublic goodÃ¢ÂÂ policy should enable tighter alignment between clinical vocabulary and messaging standards. With this step, the IHTSDO and the NLM are making an important contribution toward advancing meaningful use and the quality of care received by US citizens.Ã¢ÂÂ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;We are gratified by the enthusiastic early response to our new policy,Ã¢ÂÂ said Jan-Eric Slot, CEO of the IHTSDO. Ã¢ÂÂWe anticipate additional requests for similar uses that will provide a key driver for advancing interoperable exchange of health data.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new IHTSDO policy enables free use of English-language SNOMED CT terms and identifiers in international research databases, complementary health IT standards, performance measures, and other projects and resources available worldwide. If you are interested in using SNOMED CT names and identifiers for a public good purpose, send a message to &lt;a href="mailto:ceo@ihtsdo.org"&gt;ceo@ihtsdo.org&lt;/a&gt; for information on how to proceed. Access to the complete international release of SNOMED CT (which includes hierarchical, definitional, and mapping relationships as well as translations) will continue to require an IHTSDO Affiliate License. The Affiliate License permits use of SNOMED CT that is free in IHTSDO Member countries such as the United States, and in the more than 50 countries designated as low-income by the World Bank, as well as by approved research projects. Fees apply for regular use in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, has created a new online resource, &amp;#34;The Public Health Film Goes to War&amp;#34; (&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/digicolls/phfgtw/index.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/digicolls/phfgtw/index.html&lt;/a&gt;). The site features 18 rare films on public health in wartime from the Library&amp;#39;s Historical Audiovisual collections, housed in the History of Medicine Division (HMD). The individual titles are also part of the Library&amp;#39;s Digital Collections (&lt;a href="http://collections.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;http://collections.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the United States entered World War II, filmmaking technology was already 40 years old. The war befcame the great testing ground for the use of motion pictures in public health campaigns, both on the front lines as well as at home, as the health of troops and civilians was seen as integral to victory. Films became part of the government&amp;#39;s widespread information and mobilization efforts. The films range from the Private McGillicuddy cartoons promoting personal cleanliness and urged caution about consuming local foods, to documentaries on domestic public health efforts as war industries expanded rapidly and overtook local sanitation efforts. Many of the films are on tropical diseases-such as malaria and yellow fever-and their prevention, while some focus on soldiers and venereal disease, and others on the stress of war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the films have short commentaries and searchable transcripts, as well as full bibliographic data. The site also includes nine public health posters of the era, from the Library&amp;#39;s Prints &amp;#38; Photographs collections, an essay by the curator and a bibliography on motion pictures in medicine. All materials on the site are in the public domain, free of copyright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The problem of motion-picture filmmaking is . . . not primarily one of equipment, photographic technique, and finances, but one of thinking in a visual language &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;which has its own particular grammar, syntax and logic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Adolf Nichtenhauser, &lt;em&gt;A History of Motion Pictures in Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, 1950.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;img alt="public health films photo" src="/news/pub_health_films_1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still from Army training film.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, has a deep interest in the publishing models used by scientific journals, from the viewpoints of practical and efficient use of titles that are indexed for MEDLINE, and the clear and accurate preservation of the scientific literature for use by future generations. Â This notice presents an opportunity for others with a similar interest to participate in the development of a Recommended Practice that will provide guidance on the presentation and identification of electronic journals, an undertaking of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2010, NISO established a working group known as PIE-J, to create a set of best practices to provide guidance to publishers, platform providers, and others involved in the e-journal supply chain regarding the display and presentation of journals online. NISO has created a virtual Interest Group to provide input to the PIE-J Working Group and serve as the sounding board and mechanism for commenting on the early drafts of the proposed best practices. (Information about joining the Interest Group can be found at the end of this message.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About PIE-J&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citations form the basis for much scholarly research. Connecting researchers with appropriate content is the goal of OpenURL linking and other reference linking systems. Two things are necessary for accurate identification. First, articles must be cited by the title of the journal in which they originally appeared, which may be different from the title the journal currently bears. Second, the correct ISSN must be used in order for link resolution to accurately happen. Until there is a consistent and universally used identification scheme for articles (the penetration of CrossRef and the DOI is far from universal), researchers have no choice but to rely on existing citation elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless journal websites accurately and uniformly list all the titles under which content was published, user access to desired content is considerably diminished. No one wins-not the library, the publisher, the vendor, or the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of the PIE-J Working Group is to review the problem and develop a Recommended Practice that will provide much-needed guidance on the presentation of e-journals-particularly in the areas of title presentation, accurate use of the ISSN, and citation practices-to publishers and platform providers as well as to solve some long-standing concerns of serials librarians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issues to be addressed fall under the following key areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Titles for Different Formats: For example, when a journal is available in print and online.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Former Titles: Information about and easy access to former titles (including ISSN of former titles and the dates that the journal was published under the former titles) needs to be provided on the new title&amp;#39;s website to ensure visibility, accessibility, and tracking. Supporting documentation that providers/publishers can mount on the website to facilitate identification will be covered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Citations: Citations need to be historically accurate; they need to cite the title and ISSN that the journal carried at the time when the article was published.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ISSN: ISSN centers can help to provide correct title sequences, dates, and the ISSNs that will enable accurate linking, as well as help in resolving questions or interpreting complex relationships.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working Group Roster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-chairs: Bob Boissy (Springer) and Cindy Hepfer (Univ. at Buffalo)Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members: Janet Carter (UCLA (Ref)), Ed Cilurso (Taylor &amp;#38; Francis), Laurie Kaplan (Serials Solutions), Kathy Klemperer (Harrassowitz), Lou Knecht (NLM), Shane Marmion (HeinOnline), Sheri Meares (EBSCO), Elisabeth Moscara (IEEE), Nancy Murray (JSTOR), Regina Reynolds (Library of Congress), Rose Robinson (Publishing Technology), Steve Shadle (University of Washington), Kathleen Sheedy (American Psychological Association), Andrea Twiss-Brooks (University of Chicago (Ref)), Rachael Venuti (Sage), Hazel Woodward (Cranfield University)Â Â  Official Observers: Les Hawkins (CONSER, Library of Congress), Annette Hooss (Harrassowitz)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Projected Timeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;October 2010: First working group conference call&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 2011: Draft document available for public review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;August 2011: Publish final document&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Practices &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Best Practices deliverable/document will likely include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Preamble/context statement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Principles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Metadata elements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;References&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examples&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Appendix: ISSN Information&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Appendix: Terminology/Glossary&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Appendix: List of resources&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Interest Group Members Can Help&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review documents posted on PIE-J&amp;#39;s public Web site at &lt;a href="http://www.niso.org/workrooms/piej"&gt;http://www.niso.org/workrooms/piej&lt;/a&gt; and provide the working group with feedback.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Send examples of especially well or poorly done journal websites to the interest group list at &lt;a href="mailto:piejinfo@list.niso.org"&gt;piejinfo@list.niso.org&lt;/a&gt;-be sure to explain what you like/don&amp;#39;t like about the examples you send!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Offer ideas via the list regarding how/where publishers, platform providers, full text database vendors, and others can easily (and inexpensively, if they have to pay at all) obtain good and reliable bibliographic data about their titles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sign up for the PIE-J Interest Group at: &lt;a href="http://www.niso.org/lists/piejinfo"&gt;http://www.niso.org/lists/piejinfo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Three exceptional resources at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) are available to those who need urgent access to health information related to tsunamis, earthquakes, and radiation events affecting Japan. The NLM is part of the National Institutes of Health and is the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library. These resources are also available to the general public interested in learning more about disaster response information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radiation Emergency Medical Management (REMM)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians who need to learn about assessing and managing radiation emergencies are urged to use the &lt;a href="http://www.remm.nlm.gov/"&gt;REMM Web site&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://remm.nlm.gov/"&gt;http://remm.nlm.gov/&lt;/a&gt;. Selected key files from REMM are also available for downloading on mobile devices from &lt;a href="http://remm.nlm.gov/downloadmremm.htm"&gt;http://remm.nlm.gov/downloadmremm.htm&lt;/a&gt;. The entire REMM Web site can be downloaded to a laptop or desktop computer for use where there is no Internet connection. REMM is produced by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the NLM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emergency Access Initiative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://eai.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;NLM Emergency Access Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (EAI) (&lt;a href="http://eai.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://eai.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;) has been activated in support of medical efforts in Japan. The EAI is a collaborative partnership between NLM and participating publishers, to provide free access to full-text articles from over 230 biomedical journals and over 65 reference books and online databases to healthcare professionals and libraries affected by disasters. It serves as a temporary collection replacement and/or supplement for libraries affected by disasters that need to continue to serve medical staff and affiliated users. It is also intended for medical personnel responding to the specified disaster. EAI is not an open access collection. It is only intended for those affected by the disaster or assisting the affected population. If you know of a library or organization involved in relief efforts in Japan, please let them know of this service. NLM thanks the numerous participating publishers for their generous support of this initiative. EAI was activated three times last year following the earthquake and subsequent cholera epidemic in Haiti, and during devastating flooding in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japan Disasters Topic Page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new page of links to information on the &lt;a href="http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov/dimrc/japan2011.html"&gt;Japan earthquake, tsunami, and radiation event of March 2011&lt;/a&gt; is now available at &lt;a href="http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov/dimrc/japan2011.html"&gt;http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov/dimrc/japan2011.html&lt;/a&gt;. The resources on this page may help with understanding the health issues related to the devastating Japan earthquake, tsunami, and possible nuclear power plant disruptions. Resources from the NLM, other federal agencies, and other key resources are listed for responders, health professionals and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM has a long history of providing health information in preparation for and response to all types of disasters, and has developed a number of tools and advanced information services. The library has a dedicated &lt;a href="http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;Disaster Information Management Research Center&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt;), responsible for health information and informatics research related to disasters and public health emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;For questions regarding these resources, please email &lt;a href="mailto:custserv@nlm.nih.gov"&gt;custserv@nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt; or call 1-888-346-3656 in the United States, or 301-594-5983 internationally.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM), the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, is pleased to announce that US Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has named its MedlinePlus Connect a &amp;#34;Secretary&amp;#39;s Pick&amp;#34; for the HHS&lt;em&gt;innovates &lt;/em&gt;award. MedlinePlus Connect is a free service that allows any electronic health record (EHR) system to easily link users to MedlinePlus, an authoritative, up-to-date information resource for patients, families and health care providers. MedlinePlus provides information about conditions and disorders, medications, and health and wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introducing the winners at a March 31 ceremony, Secretary Sebelius said, &amp;#34;We&amp;#39;re recognizing some of the most powerful new ideas we have,&amp;#34; with these HHS&lt;em&gt;innovates&lt;/em&gt; awards. Todd Park, HHS Chief Technology Officer and co-chair of the HHS Innovation Council wrote, &amp;#34;These winning entries represent the high value that innovation can add. They are practical, real-world applications. They deliver better service, and they enable better service delivery by other entities as well. They work to support broader Department and Federal goals. They combine individual initiative and talent with organizational muscle. And in many cases, they deliver on both near and longer-term goals.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;NLM is proud to have Secretary Sebelius recognize MedlinePlus Connect as a 2011 HHS&lt;em&gt;innovates&lt;/em&gt; top pick,&amp;#34; noted NLM Director Dr. Donald A.B. Lindberg. &amp;#34;With this honor, she confirms that it delivers on the Department&amp;#39;s goal of harnessing technology to improve the public health. I salute the talented team that created it.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Released in November 2010, MedlinePlus Connect was first piloted by the Institute for Family Health, a federally qualified health center network that operates 26 practices in New York state. In 2002, the Institute became the first health center network in the state to have an electronic health record and practice management system. This initial pilot, supported by Epic&amp;#39;s MyChart, a patient health information portal, was quickly followed by other health care organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MedlinePlus Connect accepts information requests based on coding systems already used by EHRs, and supports the health IT standards used by certified EHR systems as part of the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Program. MedlinePlus Connect supports the HL7 Context-Aware Knowledge Retrieval (Infobutton) standard to support any electronic health record system. A soon-to-be released XML Web service will further expand MedlinePlus Connect&amp;#39;s flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Award Members" src="/news/HHSinnovates_group_photo.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the HHS&lt;/em&gt;innovates&lt;em&gt; Award ceremony (l. to r.): Todd Park, HHS Chief Technology Officer;Â  Stephanie Dennis, NLM; Ruth Lesnewski, MD, Institute for Family Health; Loren Frant, NLM; Joseph Potvin, NLM; Joyce Backus, NLM; Naomi Miller, NLM; Maxine Rockoff, PhD, Columbia University; Martha Fishel, NLM; Wei Ma, NLM; and Sarena Burgess, NLM.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;View the video of the awards ceremony on the HHS YouTube channel: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV35LY_kurg"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV35LY_kurg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For information about how your health care organization or system can use MedlinePlus Connect: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/connect/overview.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/connect/overview.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more about the HHS&lt;/em&gt;innovates&lt;em&gt; program: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/open/initiatives/hhsinnovates/index.html"&gt;http://www.hhs.gov/open/initiatives/hhsinnovates/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;###&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exhibition on Display at NLM through July 1, 2011&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, announces a new traveling banner exhibition, &amp;#34;Life and Limb: The Toll of the Civil War.&amp;#34; An expanded version of the traveling exhibition, which opens in the 150&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary of the start of that war, is also on display at NLM, on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland, through July 1, 2011, in the History of Medicine Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than three million soldiers fought in the Civil War (1861-1865). More than half a million died and almost as many were wounded, but survived. Hundreds of thousands were permanently disabled by injuries or surgery, which saved lives by sacrificing limbs. These men served as a symbol of the fractured nation and remained a stark reminder of the costs of the conflict for long after the war. This exhibition brings their experiences to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Life and Limb&amp;#34; describes the damage caused by the weapons of the time, the treatment of wounds, and their consequences for the young men who survived. The narrative highlights aspects of life after the amputation of a limb, from military service in the Veterans Reserve Corps to civilian life and the use of artificial limbs. The exhibition Web site features digitized images and documents, as well as educational resources for high school and undergraduate students and references for further research: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/LifeandLimb/exhibition.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/LifeandLimb/exhibition.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Poster" src="/news/life_limb.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soldiers at Armory Square Hospital, Washington DC, 1860s.Â  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Courtesy National Library of Medicine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Information on the current schedule and details about booking the exhibition can be found at: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/about/exhibition/travelingexhibitions/lifeandlimb.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/about/exhibition/travelingexhibitions/lifeandlimb.html&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Information on visiting the NLM History of Medicine Division can be found at:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/about/visitus.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/about/visitus.html&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM), the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, has been named a strategic advisor to the &lt;a href="http://www.medicalheritage.org/"&gt;Medical Heritage Library (MHL) Digital Collaborative&lt;/a&gt;. The MHL is a digital curation collaborative among some of the world&amp;#39;s leading medical libraries, initiated in 2009 by the Open Knowledge Commons to digitize many of the world&amp;#39;s great historical medical books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MHL project recently received a Level-One &lt;a href="http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/digitalhumanitiesstartup.html"&gt;Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://www.neh.gov/"&gt;National Endowment for the Humanities&lt;/a&gt;, to continue developing the MHL partnership and project. Â This grant will support planning activities among 10 of the partner institutions, with the NLM serving in an advisory capacity to the grant recipients. The project furthers the MHL&amp;#39;s mission to &amp;#34;provide the means by which readers and scholars across a multitude of disciplines can examine the interrelated nature of medicine and society, both to inform contemporary medicine and strengthen understanding of the world in which we live.&amp;#34;Â  NLM continues to work closely with the MHL partner institutions to make publicly available the unique and rich resources in the history of medicine held by these institutions and enhance their utility for research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More about the MHL:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open Knowledge Commons created the Medical Heritage Library through the National Library of Medicine, New York Public Library, and the medical libraries of Columbia, Harvard and Yale.

The NN/LM consists of the eight competitively selected Regional Medical Libraries, and over 6,000 health sciences and public libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its original authorization by Congress in the 1965 Medical Library Assistance Act, the NN/LM has worked to equalize and enhance access to health sciences information throughout the United States. Its mission is to advance the progress of medicine and improve the public health by providing health professionals and the general public with equal access to biomedical information. The goals of the 2011-2016 contracts are: to develop collaborations among Network members and other organizations to improve access to and sharing of biomedical information resources throughout the nation; to promote awareness of, access to, and use of biomedical information resources for health professionals and the public, with a particular emphasis on contributing to &lt;a href="http://www.healthypeople.gov/HP2020/"&gt;Healthy People 2020&lt;/a&gt;; and to develop, promote, and improve electronic access to health information by Network members, health professionals, and organizations providing health information to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2011-2016 Regional Medical Libraries are:Â Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Middle Atlantic Region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;University of Pittsburgh&lt;br /&gt;Health Sciences Library System&lt;br /&gt;Pittsburgh, PA&lt;br /&gt;States Served: DE, NJ, NY, PA&lt;br /&gt;Â &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Southeastern/Atlantic Region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;University of Maryland at Baltimore&lt;br /&gt;Health Sciences and Human Services Library&lt;br /&gt;Baltimore, MD&lt;br /&gt;States Served: AL, FL, GA, MD, MS, NC, SC, TN, VA,WV,&lt;br /&gt;the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands&lt;br /&gt;Â &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greater Midwest Region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The University of Illinois at Chicago&lt;br /&gt;Library of the Health Sciences&lt;br /&gt;Chicago, IL&lt;br /&gt;States Served: IA, IL, IN, KY, MI, MN, ND, OH, SD, WI&lt;br /&gt;Â &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Midcontinental Region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;University of Utah&lt;br /&gt;Spencer S.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/collections/archives/ammp/index.html"&gt;Archives and Modern Manuscripts Program&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/"&gt;History of Medicine Division&lt;/a&gt;, National Library of Medicine is pleased to announce the third release of additional court case summaries published as the Food and Drugs Act Notices of Judgment (NJs) (&lt;a href="http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/fdanj/"&gt;http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/fdanj/&lt;/a&gt;). The National Library of Medicine, a component of the National Institutes of Health, is the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These NJs complete the collection of judgments involving adulterated and misbranded foods and drugs published together from 1908 to1943, totaling 31,162 cases. Currently in process are NJs published between 1940 and1966, covering foods solely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collection is a digital archive of the notices judgment for products seized under authority of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act and the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The NJs are resources in themselves, but also lead users to the over 2,000 linear foot collection of the evidence files used to prosecute each case. These files include materials such as correspondence, lab results, photographs, and product samples and labeling. This collection offers insight into US legal and governmental history, as well as the evolution of clinical trial science and the social impact of medicine on health. The legal history of some of our best-known consumer items of today, such as Coca-Cola, and companies like Merck Pharmaceuticals, can be traced in the collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can perform full-text searching and browse the archive by Case Title, Defendant Name, Adjudicating Court Name, Geographic Seizure Location, and Case Publication Date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sample images:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="FDA Title Page" src="/news/FDA_title_page.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Title page from April 1935 NJ, Food and Drugs Sub-Collection, NLM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Bromo_Seltzer Ad" src="/news/fda_bromo.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evidence File Sample Content c. 1939, Food and Drugs Sub-Collection, NLM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;# # #&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;John Huston&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;Let There Be Light&amp;#34; is Unblinking Look at Psychological Trauma among Combat Veterans &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The motion picture, &lt;em&gt;Let There Be Light&lt;/em&gt; (1946), an early generation of which is held in the collections of the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, has been named to the &lt;a href="http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2010/10-273.html"&gt;National Film Registry of the Library of Congress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directed by multiple Oscar-winner John Huston, &lt;em&gt;Let There Be Light&lt;/em&gt; was commissioned by the United States Army Signal Corps. It was photographed at the Edgewood State Hospital, Deer Park, Long Island, NY between 1944 and 1946. Edgewood State Hospital was part of Mason General Hospital, a psychiatric hospital run by the United States War Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon banned &lt;em&gt;Let There Be Light&lt;/em&gt; from public distribution for 35 years due to its frank depiction of psychological trauma among combat veterans. About 20% of all battle casualties in the American army during World War II were of a neuropsychiatric nature. &lt;em&gt;Let There Be Light&lt;/em&gt; film shows how these casualties were treated by techniques of hypnosis and narcotics. As the opening statement of the film recounts: &amp;#34;No scenes were staged. The cameras merely recorded what took place in an Army Hospital.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let There Be Light&lt;/em&gt; helps to reveal the historical roots of current concerns about post-traumatic stress disorder, both among military service members who have served in combat and among civilians who have experienced trauma in their lives.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The copy of &lt;em&gt;Let There Be Light&lt;/em&gt; held by NLM is an original reversal positive, one generation removed from the camera original. The film is part of the Library&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/collections/films/index.html"&gt;Historical Audiovisuals Collection in its History of Medicine Division&lt;/a&gt;. Produced by a US government agency, the film has no copyright and is in the public domain. As a public service, the Library can prepare copies of the film, at cost, through its Historical Audiovisuals Program. Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The film collection at the National Library of Medicine contains over 30,000 titles and, because of the depth and breadth of the collections, it ranks as the foremost medical film archive in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library, is a component of the &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;Â ###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users Can Virtually Flip through Medical Masterpieces from Past Centuries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, announces the release of a new Turning the Pages &amp;#34;app&amp;#34; for the iPad: &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/turning-the-pages-ttp/id423830194?mt=8"&gt;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/turning-the-pages-ttp/id423830194?mt=8&lt;/a&gt;. The application is free and features selections from three rare books from the Library&amp;#39;s collection. All three books first appeared on NLM&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/books.htm"&gt;Turning the Pages&lt;/a&gt; kiosks and Web site over the past three years. The new app allows iPad users to have an up-close virtual experience with these rare treasures. The animated books, scanned at high resolution, are accompanied by texts, written by experts in their fields, which put the books and images into context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the featured works is a 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century Japanese surgical manuscript by noted physician Hanaoka Seishu, the first surgeon to use anesthesia in an operation. Another book included in the app is Hieronymus Brunschwig&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;De Arte Distillandi&lt;/em&gt;, printed in Strasbourg in 1512. The work contains numerous hand-colored woodcuts showing physicians, alchemists and their laboratories in Early Modern Europe. The third book is an early Persian manuscript by medieval natural historian al-Qazwini entitled &amp;#34;The Cosmography,&amp;#34; which includes colorful hand-drawn illustrations of zodiac constellations, animals, and plants from the Islamic world of the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched at NLM in 2001, Turning the Pages is part of a continuing collaboration between the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications and the History of Medicine Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Brunschwig" src="/news/ttp_Brunschwig.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;Wound Man&amp;#34; and brain localization charts from Hieronymus Brunschwig&amp;#39;s &lt;/em&gt;De Arte Distillandi&lt;em&gt;, printed in Strasbourg, 1512.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Hanaoka" src="/news/ttp_Hanaoka.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;em&gt;Man and woman with tumors of the jaw in Hanaoka Seishu&amp;#39;s &lt;/em&gt;Surgical Casebook&lt;em&gt;, Japan, about 1820.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Splash Page" src="/news/ttp_splash_page.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NLM&amp;#39;s new Turning the Pages app for iPad allows users to see rare books up close.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;Stress Test&amp;#34; of Internet Infrastructure Unites Public, Private Sector Groups around the Globe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM), the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, is among a small number of US government agencies that will participate in &lt;a href="http://isoc.org/wp/worldipv6day/"&gt;World IPv6 Day&lt;/a&gt;, Wednesday, June 8, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Internet Protocol (IP) is the principal communications protocol used for relaying datagrams or packets of information across an internetwork, such as the Internet. Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the newest version of IP, succeeding the 30-year-old IPv4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a dramatic increase in the number of Internet users worldwide and an explosion in the number of IP-enabled devices, the last of the IPv4 addresses were distributed earlier this year. To ensure that the next generation of IP is supported sufficiently, organizations must now create a parallel network which supports IPv6 alongside the current predominant version, IPv4. World IPv6 Day, a collaborative effort of the &lt;a href="http://www.isoc.org/"&gt;Internet Society (ISOC)&lt;/a&gt; and the global online community, encourages organizations to prepare their services for IPv6, motivating them to embrace the change to this new IP and allowing them 24 hours in which to test their technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day is being billed as a 24-hour &amp;#34;test flight.&amp;#34; If all goes well, existing IPv4 users will not notice any difference, but new IPv6 users will be able to access NLM online resources natively over IPv6 for the first time. Also, importantly, NLM staff in the Office of Computer and Communications Systems (OCCS) will be able to detect any problems in the system and correct them for the future. Many participants will actually turn off IPv6 on June 9, but the eventual goal is permanent deployment of the new protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enabled applications during the Library&amp;#39;s 24-hour test will include the main &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;NLM Web site&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.medlineplus.gov/"&gt;MedlinePlus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/about.cfm"&gt;Daily Med&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/MBrowser.html"&gt;MeSH Browser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participation in World IPv6 day affirms that NLM is current with new technologies providing public access to its electronic resources. Publicity surrounding this worldwide test may also generate new, recurrent users of NLM databases. NLM is also complying with requirements set out by Federal Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra in a September 28, 2010 memorandum (&lt;a href="https://cio.gov/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2012/09/Transition-to-IPv6.pdf"&gt;https://cio.gov/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2012/09/Transition-to-IPv6.pdf &lt;/a&gt;): to conduct testing of IPv6 and be able to grant complete access by September 30, 2012, the end of federal Fiscal Year 2012.World IPv6 day should not cause any risk or inconvenience to current users, and OCCS anticipates no performance or reliability challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a recent listing of government agencies participating in World IPv6 Day, go to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gcn.com/articles/2011/05/30/world-ipv6-day-sidebar.aspx"&gt;http://gcn.com/articles/2011/05/30/world-ipv6-day-sidebar.aspx&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;# # #&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) and three other institutions in Maryland are forming a new partnership. They will work together to enhance the training of librarians and improve the public&amp;#39;s access to, and understanding of, health information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the National Library of Medicine; the Health and Human Services Library at the University of Maryland at Baltimore; the University of Maryland at College Park; and the Universities at Shady Grove signed a memorandum of understanding that outlines their collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partner institutions share an interest in health and medical education, advanced training, and information dissemination. They will develop and participate in curriculums and courses, training and internship opportunities, and other educational initiatives. They also will explore areas of mutual interest for research, and will develop initiatives to increase access to careers in medicine and health, with a particular interest in reaching students who are under-represented in the fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an initial effort, the partners will work with the University of Maryland, College Park, College of Information Studies (known as the iSchool) to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;design a specialization in health sciences information for the iSchools Master of Library science program to be offered by the iSchool at the Universities at Shady Grove&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;assess the feasibility of a series of regular internship placements for iSchool students at the partner libraries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;identify areas of mutual interest for research or other collaboration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initiatives outlined in the agreement will be carried out to the extent funds are available. The partners will collaborate to secure external funding for the efforts where possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the partner institutions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Universities at Shady Grove&lt;/strong&gt; (USG) is a regional higher education center under the auspices of the University System of Maryland (USM) that provides access to baccalaureate and graduate degrees to residents in Montgomery County and the surrounding region.Â  Nine USM institutions bring more than 60 degree programs into the region.Â  These degrees programs include Pharmacy, Nursing, Public Health, Health Care Management, Respiratory Therapy, Information Studies/Library Science, and Biology. Other programs in communication, simulation, and psychology have strong health specializations.Â  USG maintains strong partnerships with regional education, community colleges, businesses and community organizations to support its mission.Â Â Â Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its founding in 1836, the&lt;strong&gt; National Library of Medicine&lt;/strong&gt; (NLM) has played a pivotal role in translating biomedical research into practice. NLM, part of the National Institutes of Health, is the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library with more than 17 million items in its collection; and it is the developer of electronic information services used by scientists, health professionals, and the public around the world. NLM makes its information services known and available with the help of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine, which consists of 5,600 member institutions, including eight Regional Medical Libraries. NLM conducts and supports research that applies computer and information science to meet the information needs of clinicians, public health administrators, biomedical researchers and consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Founded in 1813, the &lt;strong&gt;Health Sciences and Human Services Library at the University of Maryland, Baltimore&lt;/strong&gt; (HS/HSL) is one of the largest health sciences libraries in the eastern United States, serving diverse constituents on campus, across the state and throughout the region. The HS/HSL supports the programs of the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Social Work, and the Graduate School as well as the University of Maryland Medical Center and Shock Trauma Center.Â  Since 1983 the library has served as the headquarters for the Southeastern/Atlantic Region of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine under contract to the National Library of Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accomplish its goal of serving the state through local and national engagement and worldwide impact, the &lt;strong&gt;University&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; of Maryland, College Park&lt;/strong&gt; exploits its advantages as the flagship of the University System of Maryland, its location in the resource-rich Washington, DC metropolitan area, its diverse community and its momentum. The College Park campus is home to 37,000 students in over 100 majors taught by 4,000 faculty members. Graduate degrees in over 100 fields are awarded. The University is supported in its academic endeavors by &lt;strong&gt;the University of Maryland Libraries,&lt;/strong&gt; which is comprised of eight libraries and close to four million volumes. Electronic resources such as journals, databases and e-books now comprise over half the Libraries&amp;#39; annual acquisitions of new materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM), the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, the National Agricultural Library (NAL) and the Library of Congress (LC) announce an agreement regarding the implementation of RDA (Resource Description and Access), new cataloging rules published in June 2010 to replace AACR2 (Anglo-American Cataloging Rules, 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; edition).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns were raised in 2008 about how well RDA met its own self-stated goals, the costs of adopting new rules, and the lack of clear explanations of the new rules&amp;#39; benefits. Therefore, the US community, led by the senior management at the NLM, the NAL, and the LC had agreed to coordinate a US test of the rules and make a joint decision about whether or not the rules should be adopted. The US RDA Test Coordinating Committee was appointed in June 2008, with three members each from NLM and NAL and four members from LC. Â The test involved 23 partner institutions (libraries of various sizes and types, museums, archives, vendors, educators and students), in addition to the three national libraries. The test was conducted from July-December 2010, the results of the test were analyzed from January-May 2011, and the Coordinating Committee submitted its report and recommendations to their senior management on June 6, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives of the three national libraries, Dr. Simon Liu (NAL), Sheldon Kotzin (NLM) and Dr. Deanna Marcum (LC), issued a statement June 14, 2011, endorsing the recommendations made by the US RDA Test Coordinating Committee regarding the implementation of RDA - namely that RDA should be implemented no earlier than January 2013 and is contingent upon the satisfactory progress/completion of nine specified tasks and action items outlined in the report. The statement is available at: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/cataloging/RDA_Executives_statement.pdf"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/cataloging/RDA_Executives_statement.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The executive summary of the report is available at: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/cataloging/RDA_report_executive_summary.pdf"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/cataloging/RDA_report_executive_summary.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full report will be made available prior to the upcoming American Library Association (ALA) Annual Meeting, which begins June 23, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tasks that must be completed or underway before implementation are:Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rewrite the RDA instructions in clear, unambiguous, plain English&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Define process for updating RDA in the online environment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improve the functionality of the online &lt;a href="http://www.rdatoolkit.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RDA Toolkit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop full RDA record examples in MARC (MAchine-Readable Cataloging)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;and other encoding schema&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Announce the completion of the Registered RDA Element Sets and Vocabularies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate credible progress towards a replacement for MARC &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure and facilitate community involvement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leadership and coordination of RDA training by LC&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Solicit demonstrations of prototype input and discovery systems that use the RDA element set&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these tasks has a proposed timeline for completion, so that progress in achievement can be ascertained. Members of the Coordinating Committee will continue in an oversight role to ensure that these conditions are being met in a way that will allow a 2013 implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;# # #&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for Nominations:&lt;/strong&gt; As the U.S. Member of the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation (IHTSDO), the National Library of Medicine (NLM) is soliciting nominations of potential candidates for the four IHTSDO Standing Committees Ã¢ÂÂ Content, Quality Assurance, Implementation &amp;#38; Innovation (&lt;em&gt;formerly&lt;/em&gt; Research &amp;#38; Innovation), and Technical. These Committees have important roles in the ongoing development of the SNOMED CT clinical terminology and in the IHTSDO. Nominations are &lt;strong&gt;due to NLM by COB July 14, 2011&lt;/strong&gt; (see details &lt;a href="#below"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current roster, terms of reference, and recent reports of each Committee are available on the &lt;a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org"&gt;IHTSDO website&lt;/a&gt;. The Committees are described in &lt;a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Docs_01/About_IHTSDO/Articles_of_Association/May2009/001122.htm#_Toc231803482"&gt;Sections 9.4-9.9 of the Articles of the IHTSDO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly half of each Standing CommitteeÃ¢ÂÂs 12 members are serving terms that expire in December 2011. People elected to these slots will serve for 2 years (Jan. 2012-Dec. 2013). There may be additional Committee vacancies caused by resignations. People elected to fill these mid-term slots will serve for 1 year (Jan-Dec. 2012). Committee members whose terms are expiring are eligible for re-nomination, but must submit a nomination package (see details &lt;a href="#below"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;). As a result of changes to the IHTSDO Articles approved in April 2009, the majority of the positions on each Committee are at-large seats and may be filled by people nominated by IHTSDO Members from any geographic region. At present the Americas region includes the U.S. and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Nomination Process:&lt;/strong&gt; All U.S. SNOMED CT Affiliate Licensees (aka, all U.S. UMLS Licensees) may vote to select the U.S. candidates for IHTSDO Committees. The timeline for nominations and elections is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 17, 2011 Ã¢ÂÂ July 14, 2011:&lt;/strong&gt; NLM accepts nominations of potential candidates for the four IHTSDO Standing Committees.

Instructions for casting ballots will be sent to U.S. SNOMED CT Affiliates on July 21st. For each Committee, the three candidates receiving the highest number of votes will become the U.S. nominees for the Committee.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 1, 2011:&lt;/strong&gt; NLM will submit the names of the three (3) candidates receiving the highest number of votes as nominees for each of the four Committees to the IHTSDO for consideration by the IHTSDO General Assembly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 10-14, 2011:&lt;/strong&gt; IHTSDO will announce the final results of the election process during the General Assembly Meeting to be held in conjunction with the IHTSDO Community of Practice Meeting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Committee Obligations and Participation Logistics:&lt;/strong&gt; English is the official language of the IHTSDO, but Committee Members must be willing to take extra steps to ensure understanding by those for whom English is a second language. Teleconference arrangements are available for all Committee meetings, but, given the geographic distribution of IHTSDO members (currently Australia, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States), meeting schedules cannot be convenient for all relevant time zones. The IHTSDO encourages Committee Members to attend at least one of the two major IHTSDO meetings each year in person. For U.S. Committee members who need assistance to attend face to face meetings, NLM supports travel to at least one IHTSDO meeting per year. Committee Members must participate (either in person or via teleconference) in at least 50% of their CommitteeÃ¢ÂÂs meetings to retain their seat on the Committee. U.S. Committee members may also be called upon to provide advice and input to NLM on matters related to the IHTSDO and SNOMED CT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="below"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submitting your nomination:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Nominations are &lt;strong&gt;due to NLM by COB July 14, 2011&lt;/strong&gt;.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applications and Nominations Due by August 1, 2011&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine is pleased to announce the 2011-2012 year of the leadership program jointly sponsored with the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries (AAHSL). The NLM/AAHSL Leadership Fellows Program is focused on preparing emerging leaders for the position of library director in academic health sciences libraries. NLM is the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;NLM continues to be pleased with the success of this collaboration with AAHSL,&amp;#34; said NLM director Donald A.B. Lindberg, MD. &amp;#34;Since 2002, this leadership program has been invaluable in preparing library managers who are rising stars to move into directorship positions.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AAHSL president Patricia Thibodeau said, &amp;#34;AAHSL is proud of this highly successful program which is preparing our future academic health sciences library leaders. This is a critical program for our libraries and our field, and we are pleased that our partnership with NLM is entering its tenth year.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellows will have the opportunity to develop their knowledge and skills in a variety of learning settings, including exposure to leadership in another environment. They will be paired with mentors who are academic health sciences library directors. In addition to the individual relationship with their mentors, fellows benefit from working collaboratively with other fellows and mentors. Experienced program faculty and mentors will provide content and facilitation for the cohort. The program takes advantage of flexible scheduling and an online learning community to minimize disruption to professional and personal schedules. The sponsors will provide financial support for a small cohort of fellows and will underwrite travel and meeting expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty-five fellows have participated in the program since its inauguration in 2002. To date, 16 fellows have assumed director positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;As I reflect back, I realize yet again what a wonderful and expanding experience the year was,&amp;#34; said Judy Burnham, fellow, class of 2004-2005, and director at the University of South Alabama. &amp;#34;My mentor helped me to see the importance of building relationships across campus, the cohort has provided me with sounding boards, and the curriculum helped raise my awareness of issues.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadine Dexter, fellow, class of 2006-2007, and director at the University of Central Florida, said, &amp;#34;The confidence I gained while in the program has helped me with the tasks of bringing up a new academic health sciences library. The most valuable experiences for me were the Capstone and the visits to my mentor&amp;#39;s library. My mentor was an excellent guide throughout the year and shared with me many skills needed to navigate a directorship.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barbara Epstein, mentor, class of 2010-2011, and director at the University of Pittsburgh, stated, &amp;#34;Being a mentor has given me the opportunity and motivation to reflect on my own leadership style and management decisions. Moving through the curriculum and planning my fellow&amp;#39;s visits prompted me to view my organization from a different vantage point. Mentoring the next generation of leaders has been highly rewarding, both personally and professionally.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Program Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one-year program design is multi-faceted: three in-person leadership institutes; attendance at an Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) annual meeting; a yearlong fellow/mentor relationship; webinars and discussions on issues related to library leadership; and a two-week site visit to the mentor&amp;#39;s home library (in one or two-week segments).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program is designed to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduce fellows to leadership theory and practical tools for implementing change at organizational and professional levels;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduce fellows to critical issues facing academic health sciences libraries;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop meaningful professional relationships between fellows and mentors that give fellows access to career guidance and support;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expose fellows to another academic health sciences library and its institutional leadership under the guidance of their mentors;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examine career development and provide models of directors to fellows;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a cohort of leaders who will draw upon each other for support throughout their careers;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Promote diversity in the leadership of the profession; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Offer recognition to emerging leaders and enhance the competitive standing of fellows as they pursue director positions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM/AAHSL Leadership Fellows Program is currently accepting applications and nominations for the August 1, 2011, deadline for potential fellows for the 2011-2012 experience. Candidates for fellow should have a strong interest in pursuing a directorship in academic health sciences libraries, as well as a minimum of five years of department head level or higher responsibility, or equivalent experience, in an academic health sciences library, hospital library, or other library-related setting. Applications from qualified minority candidates are encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directors with at least five years&amp;#39; experience as director of an academic health sciences library should indicate preliminary interest in being matched as a mentor by contacting the AAHSL Future Leadership Committee by August 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program brochure, including information on program design, schedule, and application process, is available at: &lt;a href="http://data.memberclicks.com/site/aahsl/NLM-AAHSL-Leadership-Fellows-Program-2011-2012.pdf"&gt;http://data.memberclicks.com/site/aahsl/NLM-AAHSL-Leadership-Fellows-Program-2011-2012.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about the program, please contact Carolyn Lipscomb, Program Manager, AAHSL Future Leadership Committee, &lt;a href="mailto:carolynlipscomb@cs.com"&gt;carolynlipscomb@cs.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pioneering Surgeon Developed One of First Heart-Lung Bypass Machines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, announces the release of an extensive selection from the papers of American surgeon Clarence Dennis (1909-2005), who developed one of the first heart-lung bypass machines, on the Library&amp;#39;s Profiles in ScienceÂ® Web site (&lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this addition, the number of prominent researchers, public health officials and promoters of medical research whose personal and professional records are presented on Profiles has grown to 32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Clarence Dennis&amp;#39;s creative vision and rigorous research brought us one of the most important medical technologies of the 20th century,&amp;#34; said Donald A.B. Lindberg, MD, Director of the National Library of Medicine, &amp;#34;Most cardiac surgery would be impossible without the heart-lung machine.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dennis was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, on June 16, 1909. An outstanding student, he had hoped to become an engineer, but was persuaded by his mother to become a doctor like his father (who had died from pneumonia in 1923.) Â Dennis received his BS from Harvard College in 1931 and his MD from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1935. He then returned to Minnesota to do an internship and surgical residency with noted surgical pioneer Owen H. Wangensteen at the University of Minnesota Hospital. There Dennis fell in love with surgical research, rapidly winning recognition for his meticulous experiments. He earned an MS in physiology in 1938, and a PhD in surgery in 1940. He then joined the faculty at the University of Minnesota, becoming full professor in 1947.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dennis&amp;#39;s earliest surgical research focused on intestinal conditions, including intestinal obstruction, appendicitis, and ulcerative colitis. He worked closely with Wangensteen to elucidate the origins of appendicitis, and devised many innovative surgical techniques and procedures for other conditions. Mechanically talented, he also invented devices for surgery and surgical research, which led Wangensteen to suggest, in 1945, that Dennis develop a heart-lung machine. Surgeons were then just beginning to attempt repairs to the heart, an organ long believed to be &amp;#34;off limits&amp;#34; to surgical intervention. Only a few types of repairs could be made without stopping the heart, however; to really get into the heart would require a machine that could temporarily circulate and oxygenate the patient&amp;#39;s blood. The idea captivated Dennis, and he began his research by talking to John H. Gibbon, who had been working on a pump-oxygenator since about 1934. The two became friends, exchanging ideas and information about their parallel projects as they struggled with the many technical challenges of mechanical heart-lung devices. In April 1951, after numerous trials with dogs, Dennis and his team became the first to use a pump-oxygenator to perform open heart surgery on a human patient. The machine performed very well, but the surgeons were unable to save the young patient, whose heart defect was much more extensive than expected. Dennis&amp;#39;s second attempted open heart operation, several weeks later, also failed, when a technician&amp;#39;s error caused a fatal air embolism. In 1955, with an improved machine, Dennis completed the first successful cardiac operation with his machine, two years after John Gibbon&amp;#39;s first clinical success in 1953.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While perhaps best known as a surgeon and inventor, Dennis was also a dedicated medical educator and administrator whose trainees went on to expand the boundaries of the surgical treatment of heart disease. After eleven years on the surgical faculty at Minnesota, he chaired the department of surgery at the State University of New York&amp;#39;s Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn from 1951 to 1971, building the department and developing residency and research programs. In 1972, Dennis retired from SUNY, and served for three years as director of the Artificial Heart Program at the National Institutes of Health. He returned to academic medicine in 1975, joining the surgical faculty at the SUNY medical school at Stony Brook. He was briefly retired again from 1988 to 1991, and then, in his early 80s, served as director of the Cancer Detection Center at the University of Minnesota until 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarence Dennis was an active member of many professional societies for much of his career, including the American College of Surgeons and the National Society for Medical Research. Working with such groups, he helped to set standards for surgical education and ethics, shape amendments to the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (to regulate the growing number of biomedical devices on the market), and defend the use of animals in medical research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profiles in Science features digitized correspondence, published articles, notebook excerpts, drafts of reports, and photographs from the Clarence Dennis Papers at the National Library of Medicine. Visitors to the site can view, for example, Dennis&amp;#39;s letters to his family and professional colleagues, laboratory notebooks from his early experiments with the heart-lung machine, and correspondence relating to his work with the National Society for Medical Research. The site also includes correspondence and reports from Dennis&amp;#39;s tenure as Director of the Artificial Heart Program, and photographs documenting his life and career.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Clarence Dennis" src="/news/profiles_dennis_portrait.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shown in this undated photo, Dr. Clarence Dennis invented one of the first heart-lung bypass machines, and, in 1951, was the first to use such a device to perform cardiac surgery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine has launched a new blog in connection with its upcoming exhibition, &lt;em&gt;Native Voices: Native Peoples&amp;#39; Concepts of Health and Illness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibition, which will examine concepts of health and medicine among contemporary American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians, will feature a healing totem pole intended to promote good health. The totem, created especially for NLM by artist Jewell Praying Wolf James of the Lummi Nation, will be transported on a truck and will stop for tribal blessings in nearly a dozen states as it makes its cross-country trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/totemblog/"&gt;healing totem journey blog&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/totemblog/"&gt;www.nlm.nih.gov/totemblog/&lt;/a&gt;) gives readers a special look at the making and meaning of this magnificent piece of art. The blog also will follow the totem on its journey from Washington state, where it was created, to NLM, where it will stand. The blog captures the sights and sounds of the journey through writings, photographs and video clips. Background information on the totem and its creation also appear, along with notes on the tribes conducting the blessings, and interviews with tribal leaders, National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) members and others along the route. Readers are invited to comment and ask questions, and they can sign up for updates via e-mail and RSS.Â Â Â Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;A huge amount of planning goes into bringing the totem to NLM,&amp;#34; explains Beth Mullen of NLM&amp;#39;s Exhibition Program, in the History of Medicine Division. She designed and will help monitor the blog. &amp;#34;We hope the blog will generate awareness and build excitement about the &lt;em&gt;Native Voices&lt;/em&gt; exhibition and this important new addition to the Library&amp;#39;s grounds.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The healing totem is scheduled to begin its journey on September 12, 2011. The &lt;em&gt;Native Voices&lt;/em&gt; exhibition opens to the public on October 6, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"&gt;Â &lt;img alt="totem pole" src="/news/totempole.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Women&amp;#39;s Health Pioneer Featured in &amp;#34;Changing the Face of Medicine&amp;#34; Exhibition on Women Physicians&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right" alt="Bernadine P. Healy" border="0" hspace="10" src="/news/bernadine_healy_headshot.jpg" vspace="10" /&gt;Former National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Bernadine P. Healy died August 6, 2011 after a long struggle with brain cancer. She was 67.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first woman to lead the NIH (1991-1993), Dr. Healy was a distinguished cardiologist and a dedicated and caring physician. As noted in a &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/about/director/08082011_statement_healy.htm"&gt;tribute&lt;/a&gt; by NIH Director Dr. Francis S. Collins, her visionary efforts transformed the landscape of women&amp;#39;s health research by launching the Women&amp;#39;s Health Initiative. In addition, she established a policy that all NIH-funded clinical trials on conditions that affect both genders must include both men and women. Dr. Collins also recalled Dr. HealyÃ¢ÂÂs vigorous support of the public effort to sequence the human genome and her keen insights into the potential of genomic research for revolutionizing medicine. He first met her in 1992, when, as NIH Director, she persuaded him to leave a professorship at the University of Michigan to lead NIH&amp;#39;s role in the International Human Genome Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Healy was a strong advocate for the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and its programs and services, both during and after her tenure as NIH Director. NLM Director Dr. Donald A.B. Lindberg held that post when Dr. Healy was Director of NIH. He reflected on one memorable interaction with her. &amp;#34;When I was asked to join OSTP [the US &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/about"&gt;Office of Science and Technology Policy&lt;/a&gt;, established by Congress to advise the White House] as head of the new High Performance Computer and Communications Program, I went immediately to ask Bernie&amp;#39;s advice. She remained strongly positive about OSTP after her own years in that Office. She encouraged me to do the job, and agreed it would be in addition to my serving as Director of NLM. Additionally, she encouraged me to set up our new office space in NLM and definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in the vastly inconvenient Executive Office Building. Excellent advice. I liked working with Bernie, and I miss her. This is really a great loss.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For her many achievements, Dr. Healy was selected for inclusion in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/"&gt;Changing the Face of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a National Library of Medicine (NLM) exhibition on pioneering American women physicians, past and present. Displayed at NLM 2003-2005, it is now fully booked as a &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/about/exhibition/travelingexhibitions/ctfom.html"&gt;traveling exhibition&lt;/a&gt; through October 2012. The exhibition Web site features more on Dr. Healy&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_145.html"&gt;life and remarkable career&lt;/a&gt;, including clips from an inspirational &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/video/145_1.html"&gt;videotaped interview&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Healy also lives on in NLMÃ¢ÂÂs &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/vcenter.html"&gt;Visitor Center&lt;/a&gt;, where she is featured in an interactive program called Ã¢ÂÂDialogues in Science.Ã¢ÂÂ Here, NLM guests can hear her thoughts on women in medicine, her stint as NIH Director, the importance of medical research, and much more, with the help of voice recognition software. In many ways, the legacy of Dr. Bernadine Healy will be preserved and shared for years to come at the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Located in Bethesda, Maryland, the National Library of Medicine, a component of the National Institutes of Health, is the worldÃ¢ÂÂs largest medical library.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;From Monday, July 11, through Friday, October 7, the National Library of Medicine, a component of the National Institutes of Health, will host a new exhibition, &amp;#34;From Craft to Profession: The Transition from Horse Farrier to Professional Veterinarian,&amp;#34; in the NLM History of Medicine Reading Room, Building 38, on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The public is invited to visit from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM Mondays through Fridays, except Labor Day (Monday, September 5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exhibition will showcase original illustrated manuscripts and early printed books from the Library&amp;#39;s collections featuring the care and treatment of horses over the past five centuries.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The year 2011 has been named World Veterinary Year, in celebration of the 250th anniversary of the founding of the first veterinary school in Lyon, France.Â  In 1761, French riding master Claude Bourgelat (1712-1779) founded the first veterinary school, marking the beginning of the scientific study of the horse, eventually replacing the traditional art of farriery. Farriers were often blacksmiths and the equivalent of barber surgeons for horses who learned their trade through apprenticeship.Â  In the century after Bourgelat&amp;#39;s school opened, the practice of veterinary medicine became a credentialed profession requiring an academic degree and strict licensing, replacing the old system of farriers and apprenticeships.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For information on visiting the History of Medicine Division, NLM: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/about/visitus.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/about/visitus.html&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;img alt="wounded horse chart" src="/news/_DSC4467.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wounded Horse Chart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter von Nitschwitz, et al., &lt;em&gt;RoÃarzneibuch [Miscellany of Hippiatric Treatises]&lt;/em&gt;, Southwestern Germany, 1583.Â  Courtesy National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Geometric proportions of the horse" src="/news/Bourgelat-horse-proportions.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#34;Geometric Proportions of the Horse&amp;#34;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude Bourgelat, &lt;em&gt;Ã&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;lÃ©mens d&amp;#39;Hippiatrique&lt;/em&gt;, v. 1 (Paris, 1750).Â  Courtesy National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;img alt="The Farrier&amp;#39;s Anatomy" src="/news/_DSC4472.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Farrier&amp;#39;s Anatomy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Snape, &lt;em&gt;The Anatomy of an Horse&lt;/em&gt; (London, 1683).Â  Courtesy of the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;img alt="The Grooms Oracle and Pocket Stable Directory" src="/news/_DSC4479.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Hinds [pseud. for John Badcock], &lt;em&gt;The Grooms&amp;#39; Oracle and Pocket Stable Directory&lt;/em&gt; (Philadelphia, 1831).Â  Courtesy of the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Martin Cummings, a scientist, medical educator, scientific administrator and former director of the National Library of Medicine, died on September 1. He was 90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his two decades of leadership of NLM, from 1964 to 1983, the Library&amp;#39;s mission was broadened as a health information resource. It emerged as a leader in the computer age and it became a major biomedical communications center, transforming a national resource into a unique international force and one of the most advanced scientific libraries in the world. Also, during this fertile period, NLM was established as a new, civilian entity on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) campus in Bethesda, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cummings was born in Camden, New Jersey on September 7, 1920. He received his bachelor of arts degree from Bucknell University in 1941 and his doctorate in medicine from Duke University in 1944. His medical research interests included the treatment of sarcoidosis and tuberculosis. In 1946 Cummings completed a US Public Health Service internship and residency at the Boston Marine Hospital, after which he became a commissioned officer in the Public Health Service. In this capacity he received extensive training in bacteriology and tuberculosis at the Michigan State Health Department and the Serum Institute of Denmark. Upon completion of his training he served as Director of the Tuberculosis Evaluation Laboratory at the Communicable Disease Center in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1949 Cummings joined the US Veterans Administration&amp;#39;s Department of Medicine and Surgery. He served from 1949 to 1953 as chief of the Tuberculosis Section and Director of the Tuberculosis Research Laboratory at the VA&amp;#39;s Lawson General in Chamblee, Georgia. In 1953 he became director of research services at the VA&amp;#39;s Central Office in Washington, DC, serving until 1959.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During his time at the VA, he also taught at several medical schools. In 1948, he took as post as instructor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, rising to the positions of assistant professor of medicine and associate professor of bacteriology by 1953. While at the VA&amp;#39;s Central Office, he taught at the George Washington School of Medicine, lecturing in microbiology there until 1959. From 1959 to 1961, he was chairman and professor of the Department of Microbiology at the University of Oklahoma School of Medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1961, Cummings accepted the position of chief of the Office of International Research at NIH, serving until 1963. Over the next year, he served as associate director for research grants there, before becoming the director of the National Library of Medicine in 1964.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of Dr. Cummings&amp;#39; first NLM successes was the Medical Library Assistance Act (MLAA) of 1965, legislation of vital concern to health sciences librarians. When the idea of a grant program for medical libraries was proposed, one senior health official predicted that four years was a realistic estimate of the time needed for passage through the Congress. Dr. Cummings enlisted the support of Senator Lister Hill of Alabama and other influential leaders and, in little more than a year, the Act became a reality. Its influence on the medical library profession has been profound: it was the basis for the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM), a &amp;#34;nervous system&amp;#34; of some 5,800 libraries in all US states and territories, and the District of Columbia. Through the MLAA, thousands of institutions and individuals have received grant support for library resources, training, research and publications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An able administrator, Dr. Cummings could also summon courage and tenacity in fighting for what he believed to be the best interest of the health professions and the nation&amp;#39;s health. As William D. Mayer wrote in the January 1984 Bulletin of the Medical Library Association, &amp;#34;He knew how to marshal support within the health professions and was an articulate and forceful defender-in print or on the podium-of medical libraries and their essential services.&amp;#34; The historic seven-year battle in the courts to defend the concept of &amp;#34;fair use&amp;#34; photocopying for scholarly purposes is a prime example. As Mayer recounts, &amp;#34;It took a ruling from the Supreme Court to win the day, but Cummings never wavered.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NLM added its groundbreaking Toxicology Information Program during Dr. Cummings&amp;#39; tenure. Another major achievement was the planning and construction of the Lister Hill Center building, to house the research and development arm of the Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his retirement as Director, Dr. Cummings continued to be a firm friend and enthusiastic supporter of the National Library of Medicine and its programs, never refusing any request from NLM&amp;#39;s current director for advice or assistance. For example, Dr. Cummings carefully reviewed and provided invaluable suggestions for improvements to the initial versions of NLM&amp;#39;s Web information services for the general public and assisted with outreach to seniors and the low vision community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Marty Cummings was a very effective leader of NLM, as well as advocate for its programs,&amp;#34; noted NLM Director Donald A.B. Lindberg, MD. &amp;#34;After his retirement, he became a good friend to my wife, Mary, and me. In his community in Florida, he became a conduit for all the information services NLM had to offer the residents. Through his group on low vision, we, too, learned how better to serve this public. Essentially, he never gave up. I&amp;#39;m proud to have known Marty Cummings.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cummings was unquestionably a visionary. Through his leadership, the National Library of Medicine became an indispensible resource for the world&amp;#39;s biomedical information making that information readily available to researchers, educators and health professionals throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scheduled to open in early November 2011, a new NLM Web exhibition, &amp;#34;Martin Cummings, MD, and the National Library of Medicine: Documents Online,&amp;#34; will provide access to digital documents of the director of the National Library of Medicine from 1964 to 1983. The site is based upon the work of independent scholar Cheryl Dee, PhD, of Florida State University and San Jose State University.&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#34;Calibri&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;sans-serif&amp;#34;; color: #002060; font-size: 11pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;#39;Times New Roman&amp;#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: &amp;#39;Times New Roman&amp;#39;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"&gt;Â &lt;/span&gt; This digital collection will feature selected speeches and congressional testimony of Dr. Cummings, conveying his vision for the Library at a crucial time in its development. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt="Martin M.

The healing totem will be one of the artistic, educational, and inspirational elements in the Library&amp;#39;s new exhibition, &lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;Native Voices: Native Peoples&amp;#39; Concepts of Health and Illness.&amp;#34;&lt;/em&gt; The free exhibition opens to the public October 6, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The totem&lt;a name="_GoBack"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, created in Washington state, will begin a special cross-country trip to the Library on September 13. A ceremony to bless the totem will be held September 13 from 11 a.m.-noon in the Fisher Pavilion at the Seattle Center in downtown Seattle. The National Library of Medicine, the University of Washington Libraries, and the Native American Land Conservancy are co-sponsoring the event.Â  Jewell Praying Wolf James, the totem&amp;#39;s creator, will be the featured speaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the ceremony, the totem will travel across the country and be blessed by numerous Indian tribes along the way. The journey will last three weeks, cover 4,400 miles, and touch a dozen states. The Library hopes this journey will increase awareness of good health and health information resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;Native Voices&amp;#34;&lt;/em&gt; exhibition will examine Native concepts of health and illness and show how those concepts are closely tied to community, spirit and the land. As the exhibition title suggests, visitors will experience the views, vision, and diversity of Native people through their own words and expression-be it a heartfelt interview accessed through the exhibition&amp;#39;s interactive media-or stories carved into the healing totem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The exhibition honors the Native tradition of oral history and builds a unique collection of information that will enhance the understanding of healing and medicine, and the health issues affecting Native communities,&amp;#34; explains Donald A.B. Lindberg, MD, director of the National Library of Medicine. &amp;#34;This is in keeping with the Library&amp;#39;s mission of collecting, organizing, and preserving medical information to improve public health. We&amp;#39;re excited to open this exhibition and to do it during the year the Library celebrates its 175&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the totem &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Library commissioned master carver Jewell Praying Wolf James of the Lummi Indian Nation near Bellingham, Washington to create the totem. It is his vision, his voice and the voice of his people as the totem holds stories of his tribe and of the Algonquin Nation. The top of the totem, for example, tells the Algonquin story of the Medicine Woman in the Moon, which teaches us to appreciate and protect our knowledge, and to recognize that some questions may take a long time to be answered. James carved the 20-foot totem from a 500-year-old red cedar, legally harvested from a forest near the Lummi Nation Reservation. When all is said and done, the process from selecting the tree to installing the totem at the Library, will have taken about one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the journey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On September 12, the day before the journey launch, the Lummi Nation that produced the totem will hold a blessing ceremony. People will gather at 10 a.m. at Semiahmoo Park, Cannery Lodge in Semiahmoo, Washington (near Blaine). The totem, loaded onto a flatbed truck, will be transported to Seattle and then across the country from one blessing ceremony to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the two events in Washington state, blessing ceremonies will be held in Montana, South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, Connecticut, and finally Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine is sponsoring the journey in collaboration with the Native American Land Conservancy, a 501c3 intertribal organization dedicated to the preservation of Native American ancestral knowledge and the protective management of endangered Native American sacred sites and areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the artist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jewell Praying Wolf James is a lineal nephew of Chief Seattle, for whom the city of Seattle, Washington is named. He is the head carver for the House of Tears Carvers of the Lummi Nation. His previous work includes healing totems to honor the victims of the September 11&lt;sup&gt;th &lt;/sup&gt;attacks at each of the 9/11 locations and to bring healing to the American Nation. Â Those totems are now installed in Arrow Park in New York, in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and at the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;To get the latest on the totem&amp;#39;s route and event schedule, or to read more about James and the totem, please visit the Library&amp;#39;s healing totem blog, (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/totemblog/"&gt;www.nlm.nih.gov/totemblog/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/totemblog/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Â &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the exhibition, &lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;Native Voices: Native Peoples&amp;#39; Concepts of Health and Illness&amp;#34;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;Native Voices&amp;#34;&lt;/em&gt; exhibition will examine concepts of health and medicine among contemporary American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. The exhibition will feature interviews and works of art from Native people living on reservations, in tribal villages, and cities. Individual stories will show how epidemics, government policies, the loss of land and the inhibition of Native culture impact the health of people and communities. The exhibition also will present contemporary stories of renaissance, recovery and self-determination. An online version of &lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;Native Voices&amp;#34;&lt;/em&gt; is being planned, along with a version displayed on banners that will travel around the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the National Library of Medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is the world&amp;#39;s largest biomedical library and the producer of online information resources used by millions of people around the world every day. Since its founding in 1836, the Library has changed the way scientific and medical information is organized, stored, accessed, and disseminated. NLM is committed to providing access to biomedical information anytime, anywhere--for scientists, health professionals and the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Library&amp;#39;s vast collection of free, online information contains material on Native health including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An American Indian Health portal to issues affecting the health and well being of American Indians &lt;a href="http://americanindianhealth.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://americanindianhealth.nlm.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An Arctic Health Web site with information on diverse aspects of the Arctic environment and health of northern peoples &lt;a href="http://www.arctichealth.org/"&gt;http://www.arctichealth.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Native-American Health page on MedlinePlus.gov, the Library&amp;#39;s consumer health Web site &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/nativeamericanhealth.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/nativeamericanhealth.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="totem pole" src="/news/totempole.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;Â ###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) will be holding its second Journal Article Tag Suite Conference (JATS-Con) on September 26-27, 2011, at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conference is intended for users of NLM&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;Journal Article Tag Suite&lt;/a&gt;, a set of standards to publish, author, archive or exchange journal articles and other documents. Originally developed as the data structure for journals participating in NLM&amp;#39;s PubMed Central archive, the Tag Suite has achieved strong acceptance among publishers and authors and has been adopted by the Portico and Highwire Press archives, the British Library, and the Library of Congress for electronic journal articles. The Tag Suite will soon be standardized as National Information Standards Organization (NISO) Z39.96.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JATS-Con will be held in the Natcher Conference Center at NIH and will be videocast. The peer-reviewed conference will include a broad range of information on the Tag Suite, from the technical to publishing theory, and willÂ feature speakers from NLM, the Library of Congress, and many others.Â To register for the free conference or to watch the videocast see the JATS-Con website atÂ &lt;a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/jats-con/"&gt;http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/jats-con/&lt;/a&gt;; the agenda, proceedings from the 2011 and 2010 conference, and information for visitors are also available on the website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, is extending through January 23, 2012, the exhibition, &lt;em&gt;From Craft to Profession: The Transition from Horse Farrier to Professional Veterinarian&lt;/em&gt;, in the NLM History of Medicine Reading Room, Building 38, on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The public is invited to visit from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM Mondays through Fridays, except federal holidays. (See complete list of holidays at: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/holiday.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/holiday.html&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exhibition, which opened in July, showcases original illustrated manuscripts and early printed books from the Library&amp;#39;s collections featuring the care and treatment of horses over the past five centuries.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The year 2011 has been named &amp;#34;World Veterinary Year,&amp;#34; in celebration of the 250th anniversary of the founding of the first veterinary school in Lyon, France. In 1761, French riding master Claude Bourgelat (1712-1779) founded the first veterinary school, marking the beginning of the scientific study of the horse, eventually replacing the traditional art of farriery. Farriers were often blacksmiths and the equivalent of barber surgeons for horses who learned their trade through apprenticeship. In the century after Bourgelat&amp;#39;s school opened, the practice of veterinary medicine became a credentialed profession requiring an academic degree and strict licensing, replacing the old system of farriers and apprenticeships.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The History of Medicine Division of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) announces the release of a new online exhibit, &lt;em&gt;Family Planning and Socioeconomic Development: Posters from China&lt;/em&gt;. Based in the Library&amp;#39;s premier collection of posters and ephemera from the People&amp;#39;s Republic of China, the exhibit features over 30 images ranging from the 1950s through the 1990s, from the first years of the People&amp;#39;s Republic, through the Cultural Revolution, and into the recent era of rapid social change and economic growth. Curated by Dr. Liping Bu, professor of history at Alma College, the exhibit includes material on birth control, national development and family planning, and the unintended effects of a nation of one-child families. The exhibit may be found at: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/chinesefamilyplanning/"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/chinesefamilyplanning/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the most populous countries in the world, China saw the need to have a strong family planning policy. Debate about family planning began in the mid-1950s, linked to plans for national development. The country launched family planning campaigns in 1956-1957, 1962-1966, and from 1971 to the present. The third family planning campaign emphasized &lt;em&gt;wan, xi, shao&lt;/em&gt; (Ã¦ÂÂ, &lt;em&gt;wan, &lt;/em&gt;late marriage; Ã§Â¨Â, &lt;em&gt;xi&lt;/em&gt;, longer birth spacing; Ã¥Â°Â, &lt;em&gt;shao&lt;/em&gt;, fewer children).&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;Two-child families were promoted through public education campaigns, and a one-child policy was adopted in 1978. More than the previous two, this campaign was pursued consistently and effectively, supporting a variety of birth control methods coupled with rewards and penalties. As a result, China&amp;#39;s general fertility rate dropped significantly, from 5.75 children per woman in 1970 to 2.12 in 1985. With this policy&amp;#39;s success, though, came new social stresses, played out along geographical, generational, and gender lines, and showing a society still grappling with its population pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This site joins four other online exhibitions of Chinese public health images: &lt;em&gt;Health for the People: Continuity and Change in Asian Medicine &lt;/em&gt;(2010), &lt;em&gt;Consumptive Disease: Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Posters, 1950-1980&lt;/em&gt; (2010), &lt;em&gt;Chinese Anti-Malaria Posters&lt;/em&gt; (2009), and &lt;em&gt;Chinese Public Health Posters&lt;/em&gt; (2006).

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius Presents Award at September 26 CeremonyÂ &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM Video Search software developed by the National Library of Medicine (NLM), the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, was named one of six winners by US Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius in Round 3 of the latest &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/open/initiatives/hhsinnovates/r3index.html"&gt;HHS&lt;em&gt;innovates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; contest.Â  Of the six winners, the NLM project was included in the honorable mention subgroup.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM Video Search software, part of NLM&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/digital_collections.html"&gt;Digital Collections&lt;/a&gt; repository, enables users to conduct accurate full-text searches of video transcripts from within a full-featured video player, and pinpoints exactly where the terms searched for appear in a film&amp;#39;s timeline.Â  Staff from the Office of Computer and Communications Systems and Library Operations collaboratively developed the video search tool using both open-source and inexpensive commercially available multimedia software along with speech recognition technology. At the time of its creation in 2009, no other tool provided this functionality.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to enabling rapid retrieval of Section 508-compliant historical medical and public health films created by the U.S. government, the NLM Video Search software holds tremendous potential for enhancing collaboration among government agencies by making videos of lectures, governance meetings, training meetings, and official observances accessible. Future plans for the software include converting the video player from Flash to HTML5 for wider accessibility, creating a version for audio-only files, and making the software available to other government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secretary Sebelius reflected on the purpose of the HHS&lt;em&gt;innovates&lt;/em&gt; program at the September 26, 2011 awards ceremony. &amp;#34;Ultimately our goal is to create a year round culture of innovation here at the department...The challenges that our department, and frankly that our country faces, are too important to waste the talent of our extraordinary workers... No one is in a better position to find creative ways to improve the delivery of services and care. And that&amp;#39;s exactly what so many HHS employees are doing.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the second time that an NLM product has been recognized with an HHS&lt;em&gt;innovates&lt;/em&gt; Award. &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/mplus_connect_award.html"&gt;MedlinePlus Connect&lt;/a&gt; received a &amp;#34;Secretary&amp;#39;s Pick&amp;#34; award in March.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HHS&lt;/em&gt;innovates&lt;em&gt; Round 3 news release is available at: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/09/20110926a.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/09/20110926a.html&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;View the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/open/initiatives/hhsinnovates/r3index.html"&gt;Round 3 Winners&amp;#39; Gallery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch the video of the awards &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ceremony&lt;em&gt; on the HHS YouTube channel: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://youtu.be/6yxJKcrOwIs"&gt;http://youtu.be/6yxJKcrOwIs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The widespread adoption of electronic medical records makes it possible to more effectively learn from and improve clinical care.Â  A significant challenge is the development and wide spread diffusion of tools that make it possible to aggregate, structure, and analyze medical record data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM), a significant producer of such tools and a component ofÂ the National Institutes of Health, has partnered with the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Research and Development and the American Medical Informatics Association&amp;#39;s Natural Language Processing Working Group to launch the Online Registry of Biomedical Informatics Tools Project (&lt;a href="http://orbit.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://orbit.nlm.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This online catalog was designed to facilitate easier location of available software tools and related resources that can be used to turn medical data into valuable information.Â  Examples of these resources include natural language processing software, knowledge bases, ontologies, and controlled vocabularies, machine learning and data mining software, and visualization tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users of ORBIT can:Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contribute information about resources &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add comments, questions, and ratings about resources&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow resources of interest, receiving notification when any changes are made to resource pages &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Search by any number of fields including institution, resource type, programming languages, etc.Â  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Link to code repositories hosting resources, home institutions of resources, etc.Â  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Share discovered resources with others easily through email or any one of dozens of social networking sites &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to have a look at ORBIT, learn more at ORBIT&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;About&amp;#39; page (&lt;a href="http://orbit.nlm.nih.gov/about"&gt;http://orbit.nlm.nih.gov/about&lt;/a&gt;), or follow the ORBIT Project on Twitter (@ORBITProject) to receive updates when new resources are added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Â &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Library of Medicine (NLM) grantee Dr. John S. Brownstein of Children&amp;#39;s Hospital Boston is among 94 researchers named recipients of the 2010 Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) by President Barack Obama. Dr. Brownstein&amp;#39;s area of expertise is in novel statistical modeling and medical informatics approaches for accelerating the translation of public health surveillance research into practice. Recipients received their awards in a Washington, DC ceremony recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched in 1996, PECASE (&lt;a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/pecase.htm"&gt;http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/pecase.htm&lt;/a&gt;) is the highest honor bestowed by the United States government on science and engineering professionals in the early stages of their independent research careers&lt;a name="OLE_LINK1"&gt;. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Dr. Brownstein was awarded his first research project (R01) grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) - $1.3 million over three years - to develop &amp;#34;A Platform for Modeling the Global Impact of Climate Change on Infectious Disease.&amp;#34; As part of the presidential award, NIH will extend that grant, sponsored by NLM, with an additional three years of funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m delighted that Dr. John Brownstein has received this honor,&amp;#34; said Dr. Valerie Florance, Extramural Programs Director of the National Library of Medicine. &amp;#34;This young researcher already has a national reputation in the areas of public health surveillance systems and statistical modeling of public health surveillance data to improve prevention and control activities. His research is truly innovative. Modeling the impact of climate change on infectious disease is highly significant, with both national and international implications.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trained as an epidemiologist in the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at Yale University, where he obtained his PhD, Dr. Brownstein completed his postdoctoral training at Children&amp;#39;s Hospital Boston and Harvard Medical School. He is presently an assistant professor in the department of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PECASE awards are coordinated by the Office of Science and Technology Policy within the Executive Office of the President.Â  Sixteen Federal departments and agencies nominate their most meritorious young scientists and engineers who show promise in assuring America&amp;#39;s preeminence in science and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awardees are selected on the basis of two criteria: Pursuit of innovative research at the frontiers of science and technology and a commitment to community service as demonstrated through scientific leadership, public education, or community outreach. Winning scientists and engineers receive up to a five-year research grant to further their research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brownstein is the fifth NLM grantee to receive this honor.Â  Earlier awardees were Dr. Russ Altman (Stanford University), Dr. Ida Sim (University of California, San Francisco), Dr. Kenneth Mandl (Harvard University) and Dr. Bradley Malin (Vanderbilt University).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library, is a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More on the National Library of Medicine Extramural Programs Division at:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/index.html&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Dr. J.

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;&amp;#34;Building a National Medical Library on a Shoestring: 1872, the First Year&amp;#34;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;img alt="A young John Shaw Billings" src="/news/billings.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#34;John Shaw Billings, c.1870s&amp;#34;Â &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, a component of the National Institutes of Health, celebrates a crucial turning point in its history with a new Web exhibition, &amp;#34;Building a National Medical Library on a Shoestring: 1872, the First Year.&amp;#34; The exhibition may be found at: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/buildingnlm/index.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/buildingnlm/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibition focuses on the dramatic 1872 change in the library&amp;#39;s mission.Â  Founded in 1836 as the office library for the Army Surgeon General, the Library came under the stewardship of Army Major John Shaw Billings in 1865.Â  Seven years later, the Library embarked on a venture to acquire the most complete set possible of medical books and journals. Billings and his work set the course for the Library&amp;#39;s identity today as the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core of the exhibition is found in the stories, difficulties, and situations that Billings encountered as he began building a comprehensive collection as quicklyÂ and frugally as possible. The exhibition also shows the Library&amp;#39;s early years, exploring the practical uses that the limited collection then supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Included is a full bibliography of published materials by and about John Shaw Billings, including articles and pamphlets, reports, books and monographs, and speeches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During 2011, the Library is celebrating its 175&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; year with a variety of activities , events, and publications.Â  The Library&amp;#39;s 175&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary Web site is found at &lt;a href="http://apps.nlm.nih.gov/175/"&gt;http://apps.nlm.nih.gov/175/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data Contributed by Thomson Reuters RedBook&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; Improves Utility of Drug Vocabulary Produced by NIH &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RxNorm standard clinical drug vocabulary produced by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) now contains more accurate and complete connections between National Drug Codes (NDCs) and standard nonproprietary names of medications recommended for use in electronic health records (EHRs). NLM is the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also includes, for the first time, the complete set of NDCs from Thomson Reuters&amp;#39; &lt;a href="http://www.redbook.com/redbook/"&gt;Red Book&lt;/a&gt;, a drug database widely used in the health care industry.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NDCs are product identifiers assigned by manufacturers and packagers of drugs in the United States. They are published on medication labels and packages and are often used in pharmacy inventory control and in dispensing and billing for drugs. If a single manufacturer issues the same medication in packages of different sizes (25 tablets, 50 tablets, etc.), each size has a different NDC.Â  If more than one manufacturer produces the same medication, each assigns different NDCs.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the RxNorm vocabulary creates standard names and identifiers for the combinations of ingredients, strengths, and dose forms (such as Aspirin 325 MG Oral Tablet) that exist in drugs marketed in the United States.Â  This is the information doctors typically include when they write a prescription because they often can&amp;#39;t know the specific product that will be used to fill it.Â  All medication products that contain the same active ingredients, the same strengths, and the same dose forms have the same RxNorm standard name. This standard name is connected to other information in RxNorm that can be used within EHR systems to improve patient safety.Â Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accurate and complete connections between NDC product codes and RxNorm standard names and identifiers have many potential uses within an individual patient&amp;#39;s EHR.Â  These include the use of an NDC on a medicine bottle to speed standard data entry or to trigger an alert written in the RxNorm standard that could prevent a medication error.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, there is no single source that contains the NDCs for all medications currently marketed in the United States.Â  RxNorm has included NDCs provided by the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Multum and Gold Standard drug information sources for a number of years. Â Â Starting with the Feb. 7, 2011 release, RxNorm included a revised, filtered version of the NDC data that segregates obsolete NDCs from those currently in the marketplace. It also included First DataBank&amp;#39;s set of NDCs.Â  Since August of 2011, it has included the NDCs from Red Book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other useful data that Red Book is providing to RxNorm includes better linkages between branded drugs and their NDCs, information about whether or not drugs are still on the market, and Drug Enforcement Agency Class for controlled drugs.Â  This additional information is instrumental in the production of the Current Prescribable Subset of RxNorm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stuart Nelson, M.D., creator of RxNorm, also welcomed the new content.Â  &amp;#34;We believe that this represents an important addition which improves RxNorm&amp;#39;s quality and its usefulness in medication data entry, clinical decision support, and many activities, such as outcome and comparative effectiveness studies that rely on the ability to identify groups of patients who have taken the same medications,&amp;#34; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;We are pleased to have information from Red Book added to the valuable content already available from RxNorm,&amp;#34; said Thomas Hegelund, executive vice president for the Healthcare business of Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recently published study sponsored by the Centers for Medicare &amp;#38; Medicaid Services and performed by the RAND Corporation and others, RxNorm was found to have entries for essentially all of the drugs in a sample of 19,743 ambulatory e-prescriptions (electronic prescriptions for patients seen in clinics or physician offices). Â Â Some e-prescriptions in the study sample failed to match automatically to an NDC in RxNorm, however.Â  A more complete set of NDCs is likely to eliminate this gap.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more information about RxNorm, visit: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/index.html&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;###&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Unregistered users may watch videos, and registered users may upload an unlimited number of videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM YouTube channel will post videos of database training, NLM exhibitions (such as an overview of the new &lt;em&gt;Native Voices: Native Peoples&amp;#39; Concepts of Health and Illness&lt;/em&gt;), public service announcements, lectures and more.Â  Interested parties can subscribe to be notified whenever new content is posted on the NLM channel. The NLM site also features links to NIH YouTube channels and other federal health resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although figures for the number of YouTube users worldwide vary, most studies list it as the third most popular Web site, following Facebook and Google. In November 2006, YouTube, LLC was bought by Google Inc. for $1.65 billion, and now operates as a subsidiary of Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;Â &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/nlmnih"&gt;&lt;img alt="NLM utube home page" src="/news/utube_native_exhibit.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Resources Create a Comprehensive Online Resource for Clinical Effectiveness Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM), the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, announces the expansion of the information available from PubMed Health (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/"&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/&lt;/a&gt;), which provides integrated access to clinical effectiveness reviews. Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM&amp;#39;s National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), in partnership with England&amp;#39;s national Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, the Cochrane Collaboration, the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other agencies in the US and abroad, now makes available more than 18,000 clinical effectiveness reviews via PubMed Health. PubMed Health organizes these clinical effectiveness research results, including full texts as well as summary information, for consumers and clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effectiveness studies are essential for informed clinical and consumer decision making. Multiple studies are necessary over time, and interpreting their complex and often conflicting results is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systematic reviews of clinical effectiveness studies address this need with rigorous scientific methodology. However, they are scattered across the biomedical literature and the Web sites of public health agencies around the world that produce many of them. The National Library of Medicine is uniquely positioned to gather these critical clinical resources in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users of PubMed Health can:Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Access the whole comprehensive collection of resources in a single search, including cancer information for consumers and clinicians from the National Cancer Institute&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;See the results of a simultaneous search for reviews in PubMed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Refer to consumer medical encyclopedia search results also delivered simultaneously&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow RSS feeds of featured reviews and &amp;#34;Behind Headlines,&amp;#34; which looks at the research behind news stories&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn to make sense of research results in its &amp;#34;Understand clinical effectiveness&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Behind Headlines&amp;#34; sections&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Share resources via e-mail and social media with &amp;#34;Add this&amp;#34;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM invites you to visit &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/"&gt;PubMed Health&lt;/a&gt;, learn more about the Web site (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/about/"&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/about/&lt;/a&gt;) or follow the project on Twitter @PubMedHealth (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PubMedHealth"&gt;https://twitter.com/PubMedHealth)&lt;/a&gt; to help you keep up with the evidence on healthcare effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/about/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/"&gt;&lt;img alt="PubMed Health Web Site" height="375" src="/news/pubmed_health.jpg" width="533" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, announces the release of an extensive selection from the papers of American surgeon Henry Swan (1913-1996), who pioneered the use of hypothermia for heart surgery, on the Library&amp;#39;s Profiles in Science Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this addition, the number of prominent researchers, public health officials, and promoters of medical research whose personal and professional records are presented on Profiles has grown to 33. The site is at: &lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swan was born in Denver, Colorado, on May 27, 1913, to Henry Swan, an investment banker, and Carla Denison Swan. Both parents came from well-established Colorado families; his father&amp;#39;s family owned the Swan Land and Cattle Company, and the Denisons had made their fortune in railroads. The Denison lineage also included many physicians, and this heritage inspired Swan to pursue a medical career. Â He received his AB from Williams College in 1935, and his MD from Harvard&amp;#39;s School of Medicine in 1939. Following a one-year pathology internship at Colorado General Hospital in Denver, Swan did his surgical internship and residency at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital and Boston Children&amp;#39;s Hospital. There he worked with Robert Gross, who was developing techniques to correct congenital defects in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During World War II, Swan served in the US Army&amp;#39;s 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Auxiliary Surgical Group (one of the first MASH units), which landed in France as part of the Normandy invasion in June 1944. By the war&amp;#39;s end, he had performed over 1,600 surgeries. Returning home, he joined the faculty at the University of Colorado Medical School in 1946, becoming the first full-time faculty member in the department of surgery. There he helped to establish a surgical research laboratory and reorganize the school&amp;#39;s curriculum, and began to distinguish himself as a surgical trailblazer. He served as chair of the department from 1950 to early 1961, and was a major force in its development as a first-class surgical program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many surgeons of that era, Swan became interested in exploring ways to work on the vascular system and the heart. In 1949, after several years of experimental work with dogs, he did the first successful repair of an aortic aneurysm using a section of stored cadaver aorta. Â In 1953, again after several years of laboratory research, he overcame the biggest single challenge facing would-be cardiac surgeons: stopping or slowing the heart without depriving the brain of oxygen. Swan was able to safely induce hypothermia to reduce a patient&amp;#39;s metabolic functions-and thus the need for oxygen-long enough to stop the heart and operate on its interior. Though not the first to successfully perform such a procedure (two other surgeons had done so the previous year), Swan quickly established himself as the foremost expert, performing hundreds of cardiac surgeries with hypothermia between 1953 and 1962.Â  Surgeons from all over the world visited Denver during this period to learn more about Swan&amp;#39;s technique, and he and his surgical team often traveled to demonstrate it to other institutions. (Well-known as an avid small plane pilot, Swan logged 20,000 air miles traveling to Chile, Argentina, and Brazil in 1958, and later survived three plane crashes en route to medical meetings in the US.)Â  Although hypothermia was soon eclipsed by improved heart-lung bypass devices, which allowed much longer operating times, Swan&amp;#39;s successful methods afforded many surgeons their first open-heart experiences. Likewise, his intensive laboratory research greatly expanded medical understanding of the physiologic and metabolic changes that could occur during cardiac surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After more than a decade as a pioneering cardiac surgeon and medical educator, Swan resigned from the University of Colorado faculty in 1961 to devote his time to surgical research. He joined the faculty at the Colorado State University&amp;#39;s School of Veterinary Medicine, where he introduced new standards in veterinary surgery and helped build a graduate program in veterinary research. He also pursued investigations into the relationship between body temperature and hibernation states, an interest that grew out of his earlier research on the physiological changes occurring during hypothermia. Â Studying the African lung-fish, which estivates in dry river beds during hot weather, Swan identified an active metabolic inhibitor in their brains (&amp;#34;antabolone&amp;#34;), which he hoped might be isolated and synthesized to enable an artificial hibernation for surgery. His research on hibernation, which included studies of ground squirrels and other animals, was incorporated into his book &lt;em&gt;Thermoregulation and Bioenergetics: Patterns for Vertebrate Survival, &lt;/em&gt;published in 1974.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profiles in Science features digitized correspondence, published articles, departmental reports, and photographs from the Henry Swan Papers at the National Library of Medicine. Visitors to the site can view, for example, Swan&amp;#39;s college letters to his family, and his World War II letters to his wife describing his experiences as a surgeon on the front lines; correspondence with professional colleagues, and a rich selection of photos documenting his life and career.&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Henry Swan" src="/news/hpbbcg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â  Henry Swan, ca. 1981.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;###&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Dr. Conerly was formerly dean of the University of Mississippi School of Medicine and vice chancellor for health affairs at the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC). Early in his career, he served in the US Air Force as the director of aerospace medicine at Moody Air Force Base and director of base medical services at Vance Air Force Base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Mississippi native, who earned his MD at Tulane University in the neighboring state of Louisiana, Dr. Conerly maintained a lifelong dedication to improving the health of his fellow Mississippians, and also the caliber of medical education in the state.Â  He received many accolades throughout his distinguished career, including a Medal of Service from former Governor of Mississippi, Haley Barbour and the American College of Chest Physicians&amp;#39; Governor&amp;#39;s Award for Community Service. The critical care tower of the UMMC was named the Wallace Conerly Hospital for Critical Care in his honor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;He put us onto the path of the 21st century when you consider the facilities we have now and our accomplishments in education, research, and health care in this state. He was a personal mentor and advisor of mine, which I greatly appreciated,&amp;#34; observed Dr. James Keeton, current Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs at UMMC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Conerly was instrumental in the creation of the Jackson Medical Mall, a medical center in an abandoned shopping center that provides a full range of quality health services to the uninsured. The Jackson Medical Mall was featured as part of the Community Health section of the NLM exhibition, &lt;em&gt;Against the Odds: Making a Difference in Global Health&lt;/em&gt;, (&lt;a href="http://apps.nlm.nih.gov/againsttheodds/exhibit/community_health/challenging_times.cfm"&gt;http://apps.nlm.nih.gov/againsttheodds/exhibit/community_health/challenging_times.cfm&lt;/a&gt;) in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his 2002-2006 tenure with the NLM Board of Regents, Dr. Conerly also served as a member of the planning subcommittee charged with coordinating development of the NLM long-range plan for 2006-2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Event Commemorates Transfer of Dr. Whitten&amp;#39;s Papers to the Library&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM), the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is pleased to announce a lecture on Dr. Charles F. Whitten (1922-2008), pediatrician, pioneer and co-founder of the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America (SCDAA). It will take place Thursday, February 2, 2012, 2:00-3:30 PM in NLM&amp;#39;s Lister Hill Auditorium (first floor, Lister Hill Center, Building 38A) on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The public is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wanda Whitten-Shurney, a physician herself and CEO of the SCDAA&amp;#39;s Michigan Chapter, will give the lecture in honor of her father and his work. Her talk, &amp;#34;Introducing Dr. Charles Whitten: Scientist, Humanitarian, Family Man,&amp;#34; will take place on what would have been Dr. Whitten&amp;#39;s 90&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Sonja Banks, current president and COO of SCDAA, will introduce Dr. Whitten-Shurney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This special event commemorates an exciting development for the National Library of Medicine. In November 2010, NIH observed the 100&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary of the publication of the first case report on sickle cell disease with a two-day symposium that drew a large audience to the campus. As a legacy of that event, NLM, one of the seven sponsoring NIH institutes and centers of the &lt;em&gt;James B. Herrick Symposium &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/meetings/James-Herrick-Sicklecell/index.htm"&gt;http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/meetings/James-Herrick-Sicklecell/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;), has announced the acquisition of the papers of Dr. Whitten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For information on visiting NLM, go to: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/visitor.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/visitor.html&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Charles F.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special Display, Online Exhibition and Traveling Banner Exhibition Feature Treasures from NLM and Folger Shakespeare Library&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, is pleased to announce a new resource,&lt;em&gt; &amp;#34;And there&amp;#39;s the humor of it&amp;#34; Shakespeare and the four humors&lt;/em&gt;. This unique project, featuring items from NLM&amp;#39;s historical collection as well as the Folger Shakespeare Library (&lt;a href="http://www.folger.edu/index.cfm"&gt;http://www.folger.edu/index.cfm&lt;/a&gt;) in Washington, DC, will take several forms: a special display open to the public at NLM, on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland, January 30-August 17, 2012; a traveling banner exhibition, which will tour the nation and perhaps travel abroad (&lt;a href="mailto:nlmtravelingexhibits@mail.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;nlmtravelingexhibits@mail.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;); and as an online exhibition, which can be viewed by people around the globe (&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/shakespeare/index.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/shakespeare/index.html&lt;/a&gt;).Â  The latter will feature educational resources developed and produced by NLM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Shakespeare (1564-1616) created characters that are among the richest and most humanly recognizable in all of literature. Yet Shakespeare understood human personality in the terms available to his age-that of the now-discarded theory of the four bodily humors -blood, bile, melancholy, and phlegm. These four humors were thought to define people&amp;#39;s physical and mental health, and determined their personalities, as well.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The language of the four humors pervades Shakespeare&amp;#39;s plays, and their influence is felt above all in a belief that emotional states are physically determined. Carried by the bloodstream, the four humors bred the core passions of anger, grief, hope, and fear-the emotions conveyed so powerfully in Shakespeare&amp;#39;s comedies and tragedies.&lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;And there&amp;#39;s the humor of it&amp;#34; Shakespeare and the four humors&lt;/em&gt; explores these themes in a special display featuring rare books and incunables from the collection of the National Library of Medicine and the Folger Shakespeare Library. The display was translated into a traveling banner exhibition, which will be available to libraries across America free of charge. In addition, education resources for K-12 educators and students, and university professors and students are included in the online adaptation of the special display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;And there&amp;#39;s the humor of it&amp;#34; Shakespeare and the four humors&lt;/em&gt; marks the first formal collaboration between NLM and the Folger Shakespeare Library, home to the world&amp;#39;s largest and finest collection of Shakespeare materials. The exhibition was curated by former Folger Director Gail Kern Paster, PhD, and Professor of Medical Humanities at the University of Rochester Medical Center and Theodore Brown, PhD.Â  The exhibition and Web site were designed by Riggs Ward Design (&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/shakespeare"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" width="250"&gt;&lt;caption&gt;Images from the Exhibtion&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Â &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/shakespeare/images/ob2044-lg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rembert Dodoens, A Niewe Herball, 1578" height="149" src="/news/herball.jpg" width="246" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Â &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/shakespeare/images/ob1625-lg.jpg "&gt;&lt;img alt="John Hayter, Melancholy face of Ophelia, 1846" height="192" src="/news/face_of_ophelia.jpg" width="141" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Â &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/shakespeare/images/ob1644-lg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="William Shakespeare, 1623" height="196" src="/news/shakespeare.jpg" width="156" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rembert Dodoens, &lt;em&gt;A Niewe Herball&lt;/em&gt;, 1578&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Hayter,Â  Melancholy face of Ophelia, 1846&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtesy Folger Shakespeare Library&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Shakespeare,1623&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtesy Folger Shakespeare Library&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For a tour of the special display at NLM in Bethesda, please contact &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:NLMExhibition@mail.nih.gov"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NLMExhibition@mail.nih.gov&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or call 301.594.1947. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For information about booking a traveling exhibition, please go to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:nlmtravelingexhibits@mail.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;&lt;em&gt;nlmtravelingexhibits@mail.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;###&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Former Director Guided National Library of Medicine into the Computer AgeÂ  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine announces &lt;em&gt;In His Own Words: Martin Cummings and the NLM &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/digicolls/cummings/index.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/digicolls/cummings/index.html&lt;/a&gt;), an online edition of selected speeches and articles by the man who served as its director from 1964 to 1983. During his tenure, Dr. Cummings guided NLM, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), into the age of technology and significantly broadened its mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Marc Cummings (1920-2011), MD, was a medical educator, physician, scientific administrator and medical librarian. Highly respected in all of these disciplines, he made significant contributions to medical informatics and librarianship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in Camden, New Jersey, Cummings received his BA degree from Bucknell University in 1941 and his MD from Duke University in 1944. Over the next five years, he completed a US Public Health Service internship and residency at the Boston Marine Hospital, and, as a commissioned officer in the Public Health Service, received training in bacteriology and tuberculosis at the Michigan State Health Department and the Serum Institute of Denmark. He then served as director of the Tuberculosis Evaluation Laboratory at the Communicable Disease Center in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1949, Cummings joined the US Veterans Administration&amp;#39;s Department of Medicine and Surgery, as chief of the Tuberculosis Section and director of the Tuberculosis Research Laboratory in Chamblee, Georgia. In 1953, he became director of research services at the VA&amp;#39;s Central Office in Washington, DC, serving until 1959.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1959 to 1961, he was chairman and professor of the Department of Microbiology at the University of Oklahoma School of Medicine. Then from 1961 to 1963, he served as chief of the Office of International Research at the NIH, and then as NIH associate director for research grants before becoming the director of the National Library of Medicine in 1964.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In His Own Words: Martin Cummings and the NLM&lt;/em&gt; is enriched by comments that Dr. Cummings himself provided on selected items in recent years. The site also provides a short sketch of his life and accomplishments. The digital collection is based on the materials held in the Library&amp;#39;s Modern Manuscripts collections, and represents one of the ways that the National Library of Medicine is digitizing its holdings for the benefit of its users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through these many documents, one gains an appreciation of Dr. Cummings&amp;#39; deep engagement with the new digital technology of the 1960s and 1970s. He became a strong advocate for the potential of technology to widely disseminate medical information quickly and efficiently. One of his legacies is the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, which opened at NLM in 1980; another was the Library&amp;#39;s embrace of audiovisual methods for conveying information and supporting professional training. Through Cummings&amp;#39; efforts, the modern digital era of medical librarianship and information dissemination began to come into being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genesis of this project came from Cheryl Dee, PhD, at Florida State University School of Library and Information Science and San Jose State University School of Library and Information Science. Over the course of more than five years, Dr. Dee worked with Dr. Cummings, researched the collection of his papers at the Library, and interviewed Dr. Cummings on the events and people mentioned in these documents. This improved metadata provides additional context to the materials. NLM staff technically enhanced her work, and the resulting collaboration is mounted as a permanent online edition. In 2012, the Library plans to add Dr. Cummings&amp;#39;s annual Congressional appropriations testimonies, as well as his recent commentary-work that Dr. Dee assembled, transcribed, analyzed, indexed, and edited. These materials will provide insight into significant turning points in the Library&amp;#39;s history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The functionality supporting&lt;em&gt; In His Own Words&lt;/em&gt; is provided through the DLXS software, which provides access to a variety of Archives and Modern Manuscripts electronic texts via &lt;a href="http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?page=home"&gt;Archives and Modern Manuscripts Texts Collections&lt;/a&gt;. The new site was created by NLM&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Martin Cummings" src="/news/Cummings-b029656.jpg" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Martin M. Cummings, MD, with printed volumes of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Index Medicus&lt;em&gt; and in the background, the computer tapes that he intended would replace them (1968).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;###&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What is fracking and can it pose harm to the environment? What are uranium tailings and how can they affect my health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answers to these and many other environmentally-themed questions can be found in the new US Southwest scene (&lt;a href="http://www.toxtown.nlm.nih.gov/flash/southwest/flash.php"&gt;http://www.toxtown.nlm.nih.gov/flash/southwest/flash.php&lt;/a&gt;), that is now part of the landscape of Tox Town (&lt;a href="http://www.toxtown.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;http://www.toxtown.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;). Tox Town was produced by the Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) at the National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health. Launched in 2006, Tox Town presents information about commonly-encountered toxic substances and their possible health risks. Using cartoon-like illustrations, animation and sound effects, Tox Town points users to everyday locations where they might discover these chemicals. The site also points out possible broader environmental consequences associated with hazards in the varied Tox Town settings, which include a city, a town, a farm and a port, as well as US border regions. The contents of this consumer-friendly site come from trusted resources of the US government and appear in English and en espaÃ±ol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Southwest is a region defined in different ways by different sources, but the &amp;#34;Four Corners&amp;#34; states (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah) are considered to be its core. Broader definitions include nearly a quarter of the United States, adding California, Nevada and Oklahoma. &lt;a name="_GoBack"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tox Town&amp;#39;s US Southwest Neighborhood was developed in conjunction with DinÃ© College (&lt;a href="http://www.dinecollege.edu/"&gt;http://www.dinecollege.edu/&lt;/a&gt;), a tribal college for the Navajo Nation. (The Navajo Nation includes much of the Four Corners area, extending into Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.)Â  DinÃ© has eight campuses on the reservation, in Arizona and New Mexico. The College is a member of NLM&amp;#39;s Environmental Health Information Partnership (EnHIP) (&lt;a href="http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/outreach/enhip.html"&gt;http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/outreach/enhip.html&lt;/a&gt;), which includes several other tribal colleges, Hispanic Serving Educational Institutions, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities.Â  EnHIP&amp;#39;s goal is to enhance the capacity of minority serving academic institutions to reduce health disparities through the access, use and delivery of environmental health information on their campuses and in their communities.Â  As part of this program, NLM provides modest funding to support relevant information-related projects. DinÃ© College undertook the challenge of helping NLM create a scene for Tox Town that reflected their own community. This would make it easier for the students and others living on the reservation, as well as others living in the Southwest region, to learn more about environmental concerns with which they are dealing, unique to their part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Tox Town locations found in this scene include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abandoned Mines &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coal-Fired Power Plants &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dust Storms &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hydraulic Fracturing &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Irrigation Canals and Ditches &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oil and Gas Fields &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sheep Ranching &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uranium Tailings &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Water Wells &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Windmills &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of where they live, users will definitely want to visit this new neighborhood and learn about possible environmental health risks in the US Southwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;a href="http://www.toxtown.nlm.nih.gov/flash/southwest/flash.php"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image of SW Neighborhood" src="/news/SW_Neighborhood.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Â &lt;em&gt;The US Southwest Neighborhood, Tox Town&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;###&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;NLM is pleased to announce availability of a new SNOMED CT to ICD-10-CM Cross Map. The map is designed to support semi-automated generation of ICD-10-CM codes from clinical data encoded in SNOMED CT for reimbursement and statistical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This preview version provides mapping from 7,277 SNOMED CT concepts. In June 2012 NLM will provide an updated version to the map with mapping from approximately 15, 000 SNOMED CT concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In creating the map NLM made significant use of mapping data previously produced by the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation (IHTSDO) and the United Kingdom National Health Service (UK NHS) Terminology Centre, which provided access to data and tools from the SNOMED CT to ICD-10 Crossmap Project, and Kaiser Permanente, which included basic mappings to ICD-10-CM in some of the &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2010pres/09/20100929a.html"&gt;Convergent Medical Terminology&lt;/a&gt; (CMT) content which they have donated to the IHTSDO for US distribution via the NLM. We thank the IHTSDO, the UK NHS Terminology Centre, and Kaiser Permanente for these contributions, which significantly reduced the resources and time required to produce the SNOMED CT to ICD-10-CM Map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional information about and access to the map is available &lt;a href="/research/umls/mapping_projects/snomedct_to_icd10cm.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newest Version of Principal Computer Communications Protocol Provides More IP Addresses, Other Upgrades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/ipv6status"&gt;&lt;img alt="IPv6 Logo" height="139" src="/news/IPv6_NLM.jpg" width="285" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM), the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is well on its way to completing a project to provide access to its public information services via native IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6). IPv6 is an updated and improved Internet communications protocol, succeeding the 30-year-old IPv4, the current default Internet protocol. Although IPv6 will eventually replace IPv4, NLM, like most information providers, will support both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols for years to come. This will ensure access to the Library&amp;#39;s electronic resources via both legacy and new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM is phasing in the availability of IPv6 support on an application-by-application basis. The following are applications that were activated for IPv6 during February 2012:Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;NIHSeniorHealth (&lt;a href="http://nihseniorhealth.gov/"&gt;http://nihseniorhealth.gov/&lt;/a&gt;) 2/06/2012&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;LocatorPlus (&lt;a href="http://locatorplus.gov/"&gt;http://locatorplus.gov&lt;/a&gt;) 2/13/2012&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DOCLINE (&lt;a href="https://docline.gov"&gt;https://docline.gov&lt;/a&gt;) 2/20/2012&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loansome Doc (&lt;a href="https://docline.gov/loansome/login.cfm"&gt;https://docline.gov/loansome/login.cfm&lt;/a&gt;) 2/20/2012&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NLM/NCBI FTP (beta test) (&lt;a href="ftp://ftp6.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;ftp6.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;) 2/21/2012 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DailyMed (&lt;a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;) 2/27/2012&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MedlinePlus (&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/&lt;/a&gt;) 2/27/2012&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Main Web Page (&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt;) 2/27/2012 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access to additional NLM applications will be enabled for IPv6 in the future. To learn the status of NLM applications with IPv6 support, go to: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/ipv6status"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/ipv6status&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM will also join leading Internet companies in the World IPv6 Launch event June 6, 2012. World IPv6 Launch is a follow-up to the successful IPv6 Day, a global 24-hour test that NLM participated in on June 8, 2011. Participants in the IPv6 Launch are required to have IPv6 available on or before June 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. NLM&amp;#39;s National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is planning to make the FTP download site (&lt;a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;) production for World IPv6 Launch date, replacing the current FTP test version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the global explosion in the number of Internet-enabled devices, organizations and Internet Service Providers have had to expand their networks, which has meant a dramatic spike in the number of IP addresses needed. In February 2011, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) allocated the last remaining IP addresses to regional authorities. Although the central IPv4 pool has been depleted, IPv6 offers a vast number of addresses - some calculations approximate 666 trillion addresses available per grain of sand on earth, to the depth of one mile. The transition to IPv6 from IPv4 will allow the Internet to continue its amazing growth with no danger of running out of IP addresses.&lt;a name="_GoBack"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the near future, IPv6 and IPv4 will co-exist on the NLM network and be transparent to end users. Modern software clients on end-user computing devices are capable of automatically negotiating the use of IPv4 or IPv6 on behalf of the user. By providing native IPv6, NLM allows IPv6 customers the ability to reach NLM applications without having to transverse the IPv4 pathway.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For additional detailed information about IPv6, please visit: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://getipv6.info/index.php/Main_Page"&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://getipv6.info/index.php/Main_Page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;###&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Lawrence&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Archive and Modern Manuscripts Program of the National Library of MedicineÃ¢ÂÂs History of Medicine Division recently worked with Cengage Learning, a leading provider of innovative teaching, learning and research solutions for the academic, professional and library markets worldwide, to complete two full-collection digitization projects for &lt;a href="http://gdc.gale.com/archivesunbound/"&gt;Archives Unbound&lt;/a&gt;, CengageÃ¢ÂÂs online digital archive and manuscripts resource. The collections total over 70,000 images. Patrons can freely view the collections via &lt;em&gt;Archives Unbound&lt;/em&gt; in the HMD reading room or add the collections to their local &lt;em&gt;Archives Unbound&lt;/em&gt; accounts. They may also consult the physical holdings in the HMD Reading Room. HMD is currently planning to provide this content, as well as that of other collections, via its own open access digital manuscripts presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Response to the &lt;em&gt;AIDS Crisis: Records of the National Commission on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, 1983Ã¢ÂÂ1994&lt;/em&gt; (37,000 images; 10.2 linear feet of physical holdings) represents the complete contents of an artificial collection of briefing books, hearing and meeting transcripts, reports, and press clippings documenting the CommissionÃ¢ÂÂs activities, whose mission was to advise Congress and the President on the development of Ã¢ÂÂa consistent national policyÃ¢ÂÂ concerning the HIV epidemic. Earvin Ã¢ÂÂMagicÃ¢ÂÂ Johnson, Jr., the Los Angeles Lakers professional basketball player, was perhaps the most visible Commission member. The finding aid to NLMÃ¢ÂÂs collection is here: &lt;a href="http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=nlmfindaid;cc=nlmfindaid;idno=ncaids544"&gt;http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=nlmfindaid;cc=nlmfindaid;idno=ncaids544&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Development of Environmental Health Policy: Pope A. Lawrence Papers 1924Ã¢ÂÂ1983&lt;/em&gt; (33,000 images; 14.5 linear feet of physical holdings) represents all but one sub-series (comprising personal photographic slides) in this personal papers collection. Correspondence, field studies, reports, scientific data, photographs, maps, and publications document LawrenceÃ¢ÂÂs varied research and policy-making career as an environmental health scientist with the United States Public Health Service (PHS) and the Environmental Health Agency (EPA). He was assigned to the Texas, New Mexico, and Utah state health departments from 1942Ã¢ÂÂ1952, investigating issues on industrial and environmental health. From 1952 to 1961, he supervised a 15-year study on the health of American uranium miners for the National Cancer Institute. He also served as a specialist consultant in the areas of chemical warfare, industrial emissions of toxic chemicals (i.e., lead, gases, mercury arsenic, beryllium) while serving in the Office of the Surgeon General (1962Ã¢ÂÂ1964). While with the Office of the Surgeon General, he entered the EPAÃ¢ÂÂs Air Pollution Control Program to provide expertise on the control of hazardous materials associated with federal activities in high energy propellants and toxic weapons systems. He and his team of experts helped to write policies that would later impact legislative decisions in state and federal areas that improved the safety and health of the American laborer.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Donald A.B. Lindberg, MD, Director of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), today announced that the NLM is awarding 14 five-year grants, totaling more than $67 million, for research training in biomedical informatics, the discipline that seeks to apply computer and communications technology to improve health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than 35 years, NLM has been the primary sponsor of biomedical informatics research training in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;NLM&amp;#39;s informatics training programs produce investigators trained in applying biomedical computing to improve clinical medicine, basic biomedical research, clinical and translational research, public health, and other health-related areas,&amp;#34; said Dr. Lindberg. &amp;#34;In this era of the 1,000 Genomes Project, regional health data repositories, virtual clinical trials and real-time tracking of disease outbreaks, the need for trained scientists who understand the complex health information landscape and can render it more tractable is greater than ever.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its current set of informatics training programs, NLM supports more than&lt;a name="_GoBack"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 200 pre-doctoral and post-doctoral trainees each year. Biomedical informatics requires knowledge of biology and medicine as well as of computer and information sciences, engineering, quantitative sciences and human behavior. Because informatics is interdisciplinary, some NLM trainees have mentors from two or more fields guiding their research. Trainees come to these programs with a range of educational and professional backgrounds; the group includes physicians, nurses, biologists, computer scientists, librarians, statisticians and engineers. &amp;#34;Many of today&amp;#39;s informatics leaders in the public and private sectors received their graduate or post-graduate informatics training at one of NLM&amp;#39;s training programs&amp;#34; noted Valerie Florance, PhD., NLM&amp;#39;s Associate Director for Extramural Programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distributed geographically around the country, NLM&amp;#39;s informatics training programs provide graduate degrees and in-depth research experience in one or more of following areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health care/clinical informatics: Applications of informatics principles and methods to direct patient care, such as advanced clinical decision support systems and multimedia electronic health records; design and provision of informational support to health care consumers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Translational bioinformatics: Applications of informatics principles and methods to support &amp;#39;bench to bedside to practice&amp;#39; translational research, such as genome-phenome relationships, pharmacogenomics, or personalized medicine; health effects of environmental factors, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and other similar areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clinical research informatics: Applications of informatics principles and methods to support basic clinical trials and comparative effectiveness research; biostatistics; in-silico clinical research trials; merging and mining large disparate data sets that mix images, text and data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Public health informatics: Applications of informatics principles and methods to build integrated resources for health services research, for decision support in public health agencies, to support regional or global health research, or syndromic surveillance; health literacy, health effects of climate change. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biomedical informatics training programs receiving new five-year awards are located at the following academic organizations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Columbia University Health Sciences, New York NY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harvard University Medical School, Boston MA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ohio State University, Columbus OH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oregon Health and Science University, Portland OR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice University, Houston TX&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stanford University, Stanford CA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of California - San Diego, San Diego CA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Colorado - Denver, Aurora CO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Utah, Salt Lake City UT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Washington, Seattle WA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Wisconsin - Madison, Madison WI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vanderbilt University, Nashville TN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yale University, New Haven, CT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For general information about NLM&amp;#39;s University-based Research Training Programs in Biomedical Informatics, contact Dr. Valerie Florance, &lt;a href="mailto:florancev@mail.nih.gov"&gt;florancev@mail.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM)&lt;/strong&gt; is the world&amp;#39;s largest library of the health sciences and collects, organizes and makes available biomedical science information to scientists, health professionals and the public.

    <body>&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disaster Management Tool is Third NLM Effort to Receive HHSinnovates Honor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) and its partners in the &lt;a href="http://www.bethesdahospitalsemergencypartnership.org/"&gt;Bethesda Hospitals&amp;#39; Emergency Preparedness Partnership (BHEPP)&lt;/a&gt; won a coveted &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/open/initiatives/hhsinnovates/index.html"&gt;HHSinnovates&lt;/a&gt; award for developing a tool to help hospitals handle the surge of patients during a disaster. The portable, electronic system provides real-time information on the number of incoming patients, the severity of their injuries, and their location within the hospital so key personnel can quickly make strategic decisions about patient care and safely share patient information when victims are moved from one hospital to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius named The Patient Tracking and Locating System as a &amp;#34;Secretary&amp;#39;s Pick&amp;#34; in the latest HHSinnovates awards announced March 30, 2012. Â The system was developed and tested during disaster drills by NLM and the three nearby hospitals that form the public-private BHEPP: Â the &lt;a href="http://www.cc.nih.gov/"&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center&lt;/a&gt;, which like NLM is part of the National Institutes of Health; the &lt;a href="http://www.bethesda.med.navy.mil/"&gt;Walter Reed National Military Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, also part of the federal government; and &lt;a href="http://www.suburbanhospital.org/"&gt;Suburban Hospital Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, a community-based hospital in Bethesda, Md.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;NLM is thrilled that Secretary Sebelius recognized this innovative work and the unique collaboration that produced it,&amp;#34; says NLM Director Donald A.B. Lindberg, MD. &amp;#34;The library&amp;#39;s expertise, and the focus of its research and development, is information and communication. Applying that expertise to disaster management is another way we can make a difference in public health.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BHEPP&amp;#39;s mission is to develop a coordinated response to disasters that could serve as a model for hospitals in communities across the country. The Patient Tracking and Locating System is one of several disaster management tools developed and studied as part of BHEPP. The Patient Tracking and Location System includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;an existing, commercial digital pen that captures patient information on paper and electronically&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;an application developed by NLM to securely transfer parts of a patient&amp;#39;s record from one hospital to another&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a real-time location system that uses infrared and radio-frequency to track the locations of patients from the time they arrive at a hospital until the time they leave the facility&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;software developed by NLM that allows data from the pen and tracking system to be collected, stored, and shared electronically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the third time NLM has been recognized with an HHSinnovates award. The two previous winners are &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/mplus_connect_award.html"&gt;MedlinePlus Connect&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/nlm_video_search.html"&gt;NLM Video Search software&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more on HHSinovates Round 4, you can view the &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2012pres/03/20120330a.html"&gt;HHS news release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The awards ceremony can be viewed on the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfeTRj4IcvI"&gt;HHS YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interview with Dr. Brady is Featured in NLM Exhibition, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Native Voices: Native People&amp;#39;s Concepts of Health and IllnessÂ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;S. Kalani Brady MD, the primary care physician of the remaining Hansen&amp;#39;s disease (leprosy) patients at Kalaupapa, Hawaii, will speak at the National Library of Medicine in honor of St. Damien&amp;#39;s Day on April 13, 2012 from 3:30-5:00 PM in Lister Hill Auditorium (National Institutes of Health Building 38A, Lister Hill Center, first floor). Dr. Brady&amp;#39;s talk is titled, &amp;#34;Kalaupapa and Father Damien: &amp;#39;Here I am send me.&amp;#39;&amp;#34; The public is invited. The program will stream live via NIH VideoCasting (&lt;a href="http://videocast.nih.gov/"&gt;http://videocast.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt;), with an on-demand archive and file download, to any computer on any network throughout the world, including the NIH and HHS networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brady is an expert on Kalaupapa&amp;#39;s legacy, Father Damien (canonized by Pope Benedict XVI in 2009), and contemporary care issues. Interviews with Dr. Brady as well as a patient and caregiver at Kalaupapa are among the highlights of NLM&amp;#39;s current exhibition, &lt;em&gt;Native Voices: Native Peoples&amp;#39; Concepts of Health and Illness &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/&lt;/a&gt;), on display at NLM through fall of 2013. There is also a section about Kalaupapa&amp;#39;s legacy within the exhibition.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Damien&amp;#39;s Day is an annual Hawaiian statewide holiday in commemoration of the priest who pioneered housing, food distribution, and health care for Kalaupapa&amp;#39;s residents at the end of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. From the mid-19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; to the mid-20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, about 8,000 persons with Hansen&amp;#39;s disease were exiled to Kalaupapa, a remote peninsula on the Hawaiian island of Molokai. The plight of Kalaupapa&amp;#39;s patients in the late 19&lt;sup&gt;th &lt;/sup&gt;- early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century was chronicled by authors Robert Louis Stevenson and Jack London.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brady is an associate professor, John A. Burns School of Medicine, Department of Native Hawaiian Health, University of Hawaii at Manoa, and is chief of the medical staff, Kalaupapa Clinic. Dr. Brady is a fellow of the American College of Physicians and is board certified in internal medicine. Dr. Brady is featured in a periodic segment that answers patient health questions on a Honolulu commercial television station and is also a well-known musician in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reception, open to lecture attendees, follows Dr. Brady&amp;#39;s talk. It will take place in the &lt;em&gt;Native Voices: Native Peoples&amp;#39; Concepts of Health and Illness&lt;/em&gt; exhibition space, on the first floor of the National Library of Medicine, Building 38. NLM staff will guide lecture attendees to the reception area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM&amp;#39;s Lister Hill Auditorium is located on the campus of the National Institutes of Health, 8600 Rockville Pike.

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Multi-Media Show Examines Jewish Relationship with Modern Medicine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is pleased to be a part of a multi-media exhibition on view at Yeshiva University Museum in New York City (http://www.yumuseum.org/) until August 12, 2012. &lt;em&gt;Trail of the Magic Bullet: The Jewish Encounter with Modern Medicine, 1860-1960&lt;/em&gt; examines the modern Jewish experience through the lens of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only about a century and a half ago that scientific medicine began to emerge, radically shaping the way we live.Â  For Jews-and for the Jewish community at large-this transformation presented new opportunities, new challenges, and new ways to engage with modern society. &lt;em&gt;Trail of the Magic Bullet: The Jewish Encounter with Modern Medicine, 1860-1960&lt;/em&gt; explores this transformation from the personal to the communal level through a series of case studies: first of individuals - the &amp;#34;new Jewish doctors&amp;#34; and their participation in creating modern medicine; then the impact of modern medicine on Jewish communities; and finally the intersection of Jewish tradition and modern medicine. Through the display of vintage medical instruments and artifacts, documents, photographs, and video, the exhibition focuses on the period from the emergence of scientific medicine up through the end of anti-Semitic discrimination in the mid-20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featured in &lt;em&gt;Trail of the Magic Bullet&lt;/em&gt; are several items from the NLM&amp;#39;s historical collections, including selected papers of Dr. Joseph Goldberger, the eminent Hungarian Jewish physician and epidemiologist who studied the connections between disease and poverty. Dr. Goldberger&amp;#39;s research as a physician in the US government&amp;#39;s Hygienic Laboratory, the predecessor of the National Institutes of Health, led to the discovery of the cause of the pellagra in diet, not germs. Also included in &amp;#34;Trail of the Magic Bullet,&amp;#34; from NLM&amp;#39;s rich collection of &lt;em&gt;Islamic medical manuscripts,&lt;/em&gt; is an 1826 copy of &lt;em&gt;RisÃÂlah fÃÂ« al-bawÃÂsÃÂ«, &lt;/em&gt;an Arabic treatise on hemorrhoids, by Moses Maimonides&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;This manuscript is featured in the exhibition&amp;#39;s prologue, which examines the historical roots of the Jewish engagement with medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trail of the Magic Bullet&lt;/em&gt; also features images from the NLM&amp;#39;s collection of prints and photographs, including portraits of Joseph Goldberger and other important Jewish contributors to medical specialties such as psychiatry, dermatology, microbiology, and pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Yeshiva University Museum and its new exhibition, &lt;em&gt;Trail of the Magic Bullet: The Jewish Encounter with Modern Medicine, 1860-1960&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="http://yumuseum.tumblr.com/MagicBullet"&gt;yumuseum.tumblr.com/MagicBullet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.yumuseum.org/"&gt;http://www.yumuseum.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the NLM&amp;#39;s Archives and Modern Manuscripts Program: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/collections/archives/ammp/index.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/collections/archives/ammp/index.html&lt;/a&gt;.Â Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the NLM&amp;#39;s collection of &lt;em&gt;Islamic Medical Manuscripts: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/arabic/welcome.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/arabic/welcome.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the NLM&amp;#39;s collection of nearly 70,000 historical images: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/ihm/"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/ihm/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The National Library of Medicine (http://www.nlm.nih.gov), a component of the National Institutes of Health, is the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yeshiva University Museum is dedicated to the presentation and interpretation of the artistic and cultural achievements of Jewish life. The Museum, founded in 1973, is distinguished by its wide-ranging and intellectually rigorous exhibitions and, as the cultural arm of Yeshiva University, by its strong educational mission. As a partner in the thriving Center for Jewish History and a participant in New York&amp;#39;s lively downtown cultural scene, Yeshiva University Museum makes a distinctive and important contribution to Jewish life and to the world of culture and the arts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Dr. Joseph Goldberger  " src="/news/dr_joseph_goldberger.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Joseph GoldbergerÂ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtesy NLM/Images from the History of Medicine &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Online Collection Features Films and Videos on Historic Battle against Tropical Disease&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, has produced a new digital collection, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://collections.nlm.nih.gov/?f[drep2.isMemberOfCollection][]=DREPTDM"&gt;Tropical Disease Motion Pictures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The collection comprises 46 titles from the Library&amp;#39;s collections that illustrate the battle against tropical disease. The materials range from research documentaries, interviews with noted scientists, and public health education campaigns, to films shot on location in regions beset by cholera, dengue fever, and yellow fever, demonstrating local and international efforts to curb their devastating impact. Produced between 1927 and 2007, the online content is a component of the Library&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://collections.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;Digital Collections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the globalized economies of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries, Western societies came up sharply against the constraints imposed by tropical diseases. Cholera, malaria, yellow fever and other widespread diseases factored into the logic of empire: in war, commerce, and industry. Ambitious plans for global development were often thwarted by the burden of disease, with its attendant conditions of poverty, hunger, and loss of productivity. Through this collection, the western response to tropical disease is vividly shown, in multi-pronged campaigns of research, eradication, control, and education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the titles presented are:&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cholera Can Be Conquered&lt;/em&gt; (1946), produced by the US Navy. This film outlines the work of United States Navy Epidemiology Unit No. 50, which was sent to Calcutta, India, in early 1945 to determine the value of antibiotic therapy in the treatment of cholera. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tropical Disease Investigations in Africa&lt;/em&gt; (1957), produced by the Laboratory of Tropical Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), with the cooperation of the health departments of Liberia, Belgian Congo, Mozambique, Kenya, and the Liberian Institute of the American Foundation for Tropical Medicine. The films show the etiology and treatment of four major tropical diseases in Africa: malaria, onchocerciasis (river blindness), trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) and schistosomiasis (snail fever). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lucy Graves Taliaferro&lt;/em&gt; (1980), from the Workers in Tropical Medicine series, produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in cooperation with the National Library of Medicine and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Dr. Taliaferro describes decades of collaboration with her husband, William Taliaferro, in the field of parasitology, studying the reactions that occur between parasites and hosts.Â &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As these films show, history is much more than the written word. The collection delivers powerful visual statements about the social, clinical, and political nature of tropical disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to being found in the Library&amp;#39;s Digital Collections, the audiovisuals may be accessed through the Library&amp;#39;s online &lt;em&gt;Guide to Tropical Disease Motion Pictures&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/collections/films/tropicalguide/index.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/collections/films/tropicalguide/index.html&lt;/a&gt;). That guide provides a short historical introduction and a bibliography to this collection. In addition, the Library&amp;#39;s online catalog, LocatorPlus (&lt;a href="http://locatorplus.gov/"&gt;http://locatorplus.gov/&lt;/a&gt;), provides access to the films by means of the catalog records of individual titles. Most of the audiovisuals in this digital collection are in the public domain, free of copyright, and may be used for any purpose; a few are used by permission of the copyright holder, from whom permission must similarly be obtained for any further use beyond &amp;#34;fair use.&amp;#34; In addition, not all the Library&amp;#39;s motion pictures in tropical disease and medicine will be digitized-even if listed in the &lt;em&gt;Guide&lt;/em&gt;-as they remain under copyright protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="items"&gt;&lt;div class="columnA" style="width:20%;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lucy Graves Taliaferro interviewed on her life&amp;#39;s work in parasitology, from Lucy Graves Taliaferro, Sc.D., retired (1980)." src="/news/hmdvid-8700176A-poster-160x120-taliaferro.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnB" style="width:75%;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucy Graves Taliaferro interviewed on her life&amp;#39;s work in parasitology, from &lt;em&gt;Lucy Graves Taliaferro, Sc.D., retired&lt;/em&gt; (1980).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="items"&gt;&lt;div class="columnA" style="width:20%;"&gt;&lt;img alt="The title shot from Tropical Disease Investigations in Africa (1957), produced by the Laboratory of Tropical Diseases, NIAID, with the cooperation of the health departments of Liberia, Belgian Congo, Mozambique, Kenya, and the Liberian Institute of the American Foundation for Tropical Medicine.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Students will Work on NLM&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;People Locator&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#34; System&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, Inc. has announced the names of 1,212 students accepted for the upcoming &amp;#34;Google Summer of Code 2012 &lt;sup&gt;TM &lt;/sup&gt;(GSoC 2012),&amp;#34; among them two students who will work with mentors at the Lister Hill Center, an R&amp;#38;D division of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) on improving software to help with family reunification after a disaster. NLM is the world&amp;#39;s largest biomedical library and part of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Begun in 2005, the GSoC program pays stipends to students to work during the summer on specific tasks for organizations involved with open source software development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Google announced its list of 180 organizations that would be eligible for this program, based on their ability to develop and mentor project tasks. Among the eligible organizations was the Sahana Software Foundation (SSF), whose members develop open source software for disaster preparation and response. Each organization then encouraged interested students to formulate project proposals and demonstrate appropriate technical skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SSF chose seven students at their universities to work with during the summer. Of these, two will be mentored in extending the People Locator software developed by NLM&amp;#39;s Lost Person Finder team (&lt;a href="http://lpf.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://lpf.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;), or in developing modules that could be used by People Locator in the future. Members of the NLM team, who collaborate with SSF and are prime contributors to the open source software distributed by SSF, will mentor the students.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People Locator allows the reporting and searching for missing and found people, and may be viewed on the Web site (&lt;a href="https://pl.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;https://pl.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;).Â  The site was i&lt;a name="_GoBack"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;nitially conceived and tailored to assist with local disaster triage intake and family counseling by nearby hospitals, that joined with NLM in the Bethesda Hospitals&amp;#39; Emergency Preparedness Partnership (&lt;a href="http://www.bethesdahospitalsemergencypartnership.org/"&gt;http://www.bethesdahospitalsemergencypartnership.org/&lt;/a&gt;). Since the Haiti earthquake, the scope of PL has been enlarged to assist with reunification-outreach in national and international disasters such as the Tohoku, Japan earthquake and Typhoon Sendong, which struck the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are profiles of NLM&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;Google Summer of Code 2012&amp;#34; students:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ahmad Alinat&lt;/strong&gt; is a third-year undergraduate in information systems,Â School of Social Sciences, University of Haifa, Israel. He has extensive experience in PHP, the software language underlying PL, in particular with &amp;#34;WordPress&amp;#34; plug-ins and the &amp;#34;Zend&amp;#34; framework. His GSoC project involves exporting information about people missing and found. He plans to add a rich set of data-export capabilities, both through file-based methods (like generating Excel documents) and data feeds (such as RSS). Some of the methods will focus on geolocated data suitable for portrayal on maps, important for rescue missions and situational awareness in disasters. His primary mentor at NLM will be Dr. Glenn Pearson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramindu Deshapriya&lt;/strong&gt; assisted LPF during last year&amp;#39;s Google Summer of Code and has a follow-on project this year, to build out full capabilities for the expression of the PL/Vesuvius Web site in multiple languages. This involves a hybrid model, to support:Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distributed human translators in a broad array of languages, working through the &amp;#34;Pootle&amp;#34; system;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On-the-fly fill-in by machine-translation; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maximum-quality translation of select Web pages and languages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramindu is a fourth-year undergraduate in Information Technology at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.Â His prior experience with PHP includes work with the &amp;#34;Joomla!&amp;#34; project. Greg Miernicki will be his primary mentor at NLM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other NLM team members Lan Le and Leif Neve will also assist with mentoring. One of the project leads, Glenn Pearson, who has worked with GSoC students in the past, noted, &amp;#34;Here at NLM, we look forward to these Summer of Code students, and indeed all our summer students and interns. Together they further their education, advance our missions and contribute to a better world.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;To learn more:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google announcement: &lt;a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2012/04/students-announced-for-google-summer-of.html"&gt;http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2012/04/students-announced-for-google-summer-of.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google student list: &lt;a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/projects/list/google/gsoc2012"&gt;http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/projects/list/google/gsoc2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sahana announcement: &lt;a href="http://sahanafoundation.org/sahana-accepts-seven-for-gsoc-2012/"&gt;http://sahanafoundation.org/sahana-accepts-seven-for-gsoc-2012/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;To give those who can&amp;#39;t travel to Bethesda, Maryland to see it in person a lively virtual experience, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) announces a new, free iPad app that captures the contents of its popular exhibition, &lt;em&gt;Native Voices: Native Peoples&amp;#39; Concepts of Health and Illness &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/index.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/index.html&lt;/a&gt;), currently on display. NLM is the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app lets users explore video interviews with tribal elders, healers and other prominent people who practice traditional medicine, Western medicine or a combination of both. From their unique experiences and perspectives, they weave a tapestry of stories of the vibrant and diverse cultures of and medicine ways practiced by Alaska Natives, Native Americans and Native Hawaiians. Other video clips provide an exhibition overview and highlights of the 4,400-mile journey of a totem pole specially crafted for the exhibition, from Washington state to the NIH campus in Bethesda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To download the free app, go to: &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nlm-native-voices/id521226050?mt=8"&gt;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nlm-native-voices/id521226050?mt=8&lt;/a&gt;, click on the blue &amp;#34;View in iTunes&amp;#34; button on the left, beneath the app logo, and follow instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to content from &lt;em&gt;Native Voices: Native Peoples&amp;#39; Concepts of Health and Illness&lt;/em&gt;, the app contains an &amp;#34;About NLM&amp;#34; feature, which allows public to get information about the National Library of Medicine and also learn how to &amp;#34;Visit NLM&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Connect with NLM&amp;#34; via social media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="items"&gt;&lt;div class="columnA" style="width:45%;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnB" style="width:50%;"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Images:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="items"&gt;&lt;div class="columnA" style="width:45%;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The splash page for the NLM Native Voices app shows the exhibition logo and four of the featured interview subjects." src="/news/NV_app_splash.jpg" style="float: right;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnB" style="width:50%;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The splash page for the NLM Native Voices app shows the exhibition logo and four of the featured interview subjects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="items"&gt;&lt;div class="columnA" style="width:45%;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="NLM Director Dr. Donald A.B.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM), the worldÃ¢ÂÂs largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, is among the Medical Heritage Library (MHL) (&lt;a href="http://www.medicalheritage.org"&gt;www.medicalheritage.org&lt;/a&gt;) member libraries participating in a project to digitize an estimated 6,000 volumes from 200 historical American medical journal titles published between 1797 and 1923.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding for the digitization of these journals from the collections of Columbia, Harvard and Yale Universities and the College of Physicians of Philadelphia is made available through a two-year grant awarded March 2012 from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to Open Knowledge Commons (OKC) (&lt;a href="http://www.knowledgecommons.org"&gt;www.knowledgecommons.org&lt;/a&gt;).ÃÂ  NLM and other MHL collaborators not directly involved in the digitization will assist the effort by providing journal volumes that the four participants do not hold. The digitized journals will join the more than 33,000 monographs, serials, pamphlets, and films currently available in the MHL. The digitized journals will be made freely available to researchers through the Medical Heritage Library collection in the Internet Archive (&lt;a href="http://archive.org/details/medicalheritagelibrary"&gt;http://archive.org/details/medicalheritagelibrary&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Medical Heritage Library:&lt;br /&gt;The MHL (&lt;a href="http://www.medicalheritage.org"&gt;www.medicalheritage.org&lt;/a&gt;) is a content centered digital community supporting research, education, and dialog that enables the history of medicine to contribute to a deeper understanding of human health and society. It serves as the point of access to a valuable body of quality curated digital materials and to the broader digital and nondigital holdings of its members. It was established in 2010 with funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation via the OKC to digitize 30,000 medical rare books. In addition to the participants named above, MHL contributors are Johns Hopkins University, New York Academy of Medicine, the New York Public Library, and the Wellcome Library; content contributors include Duke University, UMass Medical School, and the University of Toronto. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the NEH/Digital Humanities Program:&lt;br /&gt;Created in 1965 as an independent federal agency, the National Endowment for the Humanities supports research and learning in history, literature, philosophy, and other areas of the humanities by funding selected, peer-reviewed proposals from around the nation.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, has a deep interest in the publishing models used by scientific journals, from the viewpoints of practical and efficient use of titles that are indexed for MEDLINE, and the clear and accurate preservation of the scientific literature for use by future generations. Â This notice presents an opportunity for others with a similar interest to participate in the development of a Recommended Practice that will provide guidance on the presentation and identification of electronic journals, an undertaking of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO). &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NISO has released the draft Recommended Practice &amp;#34;PIE-J: Presentation &amp;#38; Identification of E-Journals&amp;#34; (NISO RP-16-201x) for public review and comment &lt;strong&gt;through July 5, 2012&lt;/strong&gt;. (The PIE-J draft Recommended Practice and an online commenting form are available from the NISO PIE-J workroom at: &lt;a href="http://www.niso.org/workrooms/piej/"&gt;http://www.niso.org/workrooms/piej/&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Recommended Practice was developed to provide guidance on the presentation of e-journals-particularly in the areas of title presentation, accurate use of ISSN, and citation practices-to publishers and platform providers, as well as to solve some long-standing concerns of serials librarians. In addition to the recommendations, the document includes extensive examples of good practices using screenshots from various publishers&amp;#39; online journals platforms; a discussion of helpful resources for obtaining title history and ISSN information; an overview of the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) and key points for using it correctly; an explanation of the Digital Object Identifier (DOIÂ®), the registration agency CrossRef, and tips on using DOIs for journal title management; and a review of related standards and recommended practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citations form the basis for much scholarly research. Connecting researchers with appropriate content is the goal of OpenURL linking and other reference linking systems. Unless journal websites accurately and uniformly list all the titles under which content was published, user access to desired content is considerably diminished. For example, many e-journal publishers and aggregators now place digitized content originally published under an earlier title on the website for the current title, using the current ISSN, thus seriously impeding the researcher&amp;#39;s ability to find or identify the content being sought. The PIE-J project was initiated to address these issues. The PIE-J Recommended Practice provides a clear and succinct list of guidelines that publishers can easily implement to facilitate long-term access to their e-journal content. This constructive advice will aid publishers with the presentation of born-digital content as well as supporting the continued digitization of content from journals originally published only in print.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cynthia Hodgson&lt;br /&gt;Technical Editor / Consultant&lt;br /&gt;National Information Standards Organization&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:chodgson@niso.org"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chodgson@niso.org&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;301.654.2512&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Â &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, and its History of Medicine Division are pleased to announce the launch of a new user interface for the IndexCat database, along with the addition of two new collections involving medieval scientific English and Latin texts.ÃÂ  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using software developed by Ex Libris, Inc., the new IndexCat interface offers improved viewing capabilities and new layouts for search results and record displays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen capture of search options for interface at indexcat.nlm.nih.gov." src="/news/Indexcat.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IndexCat is available online, free of charge, at: &lt;a href="http://indexcat.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;http://indexcat.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Providing access to the digitized version of the printed, 61-volume &lt;em&gt;Index-Catalogue of the Library of the Surgeon General&amp;#39;s Office&lt;/em&gt;, IndexCat contains over 4.5 million references to over 3.7 million bibliographic items dating from over five centuries and covering subjects of the basic sciences, scientific research, civilian and military medicine, public health, and hospital administration. Language coverage is international with citations in European and Slavic languages, Greek script, and Romanized Chinese and Japanese titles Ã¢ÂÂ some with English translations. A wide range of materials can be discovered through IndexCat, including books, journal articles, dissertations, pamphlets, reports, newspaper clippings, case studies, obituary notices, letters, portraits, as well as rare books and manuscripts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about the original Index-Catalogue, see: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/indexcat/abouticatalogue.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/indexcat/abouticatalogue.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two new collections now available through IndexCat are part of an NLM-supported project undertaken in conjunction with the University of Missouri-Kansas City. These seminal, historical collections are developed from the enriched electronic database of &lt;em&gt;A Catalogue of Incipits of Mediaeval Scientific Writings in Latin&lt;/em&gt; (rev.), by Lynn Thorndike and Pearl Kibre (eTK) and the updated and expanded electronic version of &lt;em&gt;Scientific and Medical Writings in Old and Middle English: An Electronic Reference&lt;/em&gt; (eVK2) edited by Linda Ehrsam Voigts and Patricia Deery Kurtz. Opening a new frontier in historical research, these resources encompass over 42,000 records of incipits, or the beginning words of a medieval manuscript or early printed book. IndexCat users can search incipit data by manuscript, library, author/translator, title, subject, date and other information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information about IndexCat, visit the IndexCat homepage at: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/indexcat/index.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/indexcat/index.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for Nominations:&lt;/strong&gt; As the U.S. Member of the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation (IHTSDO), the National Library of Medicine (NLM) is soliciting nominations of potential candidates for the four IHTSDO Standing Committees Ã¢ÂÂ Content, Quality Assurance, Implementation &amp;#38; Innovation, and Technical. These Committees have important roles in the ongoing development of the SNOMED CT clinical terminology and in the IHTSDO. Nominations are &lt;strong&gt;due to NLM by COB June 29, 2012&lt;/strong&gt; (see details &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/IHTSDONominate2012.html#below"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current roster, terms of reference, and recent reports of each Committee are available on the &lt;a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org/index.php?id=530"&gt;IHTSDO website&lt;/a&gt;. The Committees are described in &lt;a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Docs_01/About_IHTSDO/Articles_of_Association/Version_11.0_7_Dec_2010/Articles_of_Association_Version_11.0_As_amended_on_7_Dec_2010_ENG_HTML.htm#_Toc262215830"&gt;Sections 9.4-9.9 of the Articles of the IHTSDO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly half of each Standing CommitteeÃ¢ÂÂs 12 members are serving terms that expire in December 2012. People elected to these slots will serve for 2 years (Jan. 2013-Dec. 2014). There may be additional Committee vacancies caused by resignations. People elected to fill these mid-term slots will serve for 1 year (Jan-Dec. 2013).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Committee members whose terms are expiring are eligible for re-nomination to the same committee provided they have not served more than six consecutive years on that committee.ÃÂ  Re-nomination to the same committee is possible after sitting out a minimum of one year from the date they left the Committee.ÃÂ  There is no impediment to a Committee member leaving one Committee and being nominated to another.ÃÂ  Committee members eligible for re-nomination must submit a nomination package (see details &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/IHTSDONominate2012.html#below"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of changes to the IHTSDO Articles approved in April 2009, the majority of positions on each Committee are at-large seats and may be filled by people nominated by IHTSDO Members from any geographic region. ÃÂ At present the Americas region includes the U.S. and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Nomination Process:&lt;/strong&gt; All U.S. SNOMED CT Affiliate Licensees (aka, all U.S. UMLS Licensees) may vote to select the U.S. candidates for IHTSDO Committees. The timeline for nominations and elections is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 4 Ã¢ÂÂ June 29:&lt;/strong&gt; NLM accepts nominations of potential candidates for the four IHTSDO Standing Committees. Only candidates with complete nomination packets will be accepted (see &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/IHTSDONominate2012.html#below"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt; for details and required forms). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 16 Ã¢ÂÂ August 17:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. SNOMED CT Affiliates cast votes for their top three candidates for each Standing Committee. Instructions for casting ballots will be sent to U.S. SNOMED CT Affiliates on July 16th. For each Committee, the three candidates receiving the highest number of votes will become the U.S. nominees for the Committee. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 1, 2012:&lt;/strong&gt; NLM will submit the names of the three (3) candidates receiving the highest number of votes as nominees for each of the four Committees to the IHTSDO for consideration by the IHTSDO General Assembly. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 22-26, 2012:&lt;/strong&gt; IHTSDO will announce the final results of the election process during the General Assembly Meeting to be held in conjunction with the IHTSDO Community of Practice Meeting. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Committee Obligations and Participation Logistics:&lt;/strong&gt; English is the official language of the IHTSDO, but Committee Members must be willing to take extra steps to ensure understanding by those for whom English is a second language. Teleconference arrangements are available for all Committee meetings, but, given the geographic distribution of IHTSDO members (currently Australia, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Iceland, Israel, Lithuania, Malta, New Zealand, Poland, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States), meeting schedules cannot be convenient for all relevant time zones. The IHTSDO encourages Committee Members to attend at least one of the two major IHTSDO meetings each year in person. For U.S. Committee members who need assistance to attend face to face meetings, NLM will support travel to one IHTSDO meeting per year. Committee Members must participate (either in person or via teleconference) in at least 50% of their CommitteeÃ¢ÂÂs meetings to retain their seat on the Committee. U.S. Committee members may also be called upon to provide advice and input to NLM on matters related to the IHTSDO and SNOMED CT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="below" name="below"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submitting your nomination:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Nominations are &lt;strong&gt;due to NLM by COB June 29, 2012&lt;/strong&gt;.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The History of Medicine Division of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) announces the public release of the papers of John B. Calhoun (1917-1995), a noted behavioral sciences researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), a component of the National Institutes of Health. From the 1950s through the 1980s, Dr. Calhoun investigated the behavior of mice and rats under conditions of extreme crowding. He, as well as other social scientists, policy makers, and pundits, readily extrapolated his work to comment on human crowding in urban settings, just as the country was undergoing a massive redevelopment of its urban structures. His conclusions found a ready audience among those who saw world overpopulation as not just a problem of resources, but of social cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a side note, Calhoun&amp;#39;s work with rats inspired the 1971 children&amp;#39;s book, &lt;em&gt;Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH, &lt;/em&gt;by Robert C. O&amp;#39;Brien, which was adapted into a 1982 animated film, &lt;em&gt;The Secret of NIMH.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John B. Calhoun was born in Elkton, Tennessee, in 1917. After undergraduate education at the University of Virginia (BA, 1939), and graduate work in zoology at Northwestern University (PhD, 1943), he did post-graduate work and teaching at Emory University, the Ohio State University, and the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health, studying the ecology and sociology of Norway rats. After further work at the Jackson Memorial Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, and the Army Graduate School at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, in 1954 he joined the Section on Perception in the Laboratory of Psychology at the NIMH. He spent the rest of his career there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studying rats under conditions of hyper-crowding, Calhoun observed what he termed the &amp;#34;behavioral sink.&amp;#34; This referred to aberrant behaviors such as hyperaggression, failure to breed normally, infant cannibalism, increased mortality, and aberrant sexual patterns in such overcrowded situations. His general conclusion was that &amp;#34;space itself is a necessity.&amp;#34; In the 1960s, his research switched into the field of evolution and behavior, which informs the current field of evolutionary psychology. In 1963 he formed and was the first director of NIMH&amp;#39;s Unit for Research on Behavioral Systems (URBS) in the Laboratory of Brain Evolution and Behavior (LBEB). He there observed the effects of crowding on a mouse community that was allowed to overpopulate, seeing a complete end to reproduction, with the entire population dying off. Calhoun coined the term &amp;#34;universal autism&amp;#34; to describe the group&amp;#39;s behavior at that final point, as they became incapable of the social interaction essential for survival. In the mid-1970s, his research moved in turn to the cultural modes that rats acquired to counteract the effects of overcrowding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calhoun retired from NIMH in 1984, but continued to work on his research results until his death on September 7, 1995.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collection, &amp;#34;MS C 586,&amp;#34; comprises 196 linear feet of materials, with records predominantly from 1954 to 1986. It was donated in 1997, as a gift from Edith Calhoun, his widow. In addition to laboratory notebooks and drafts of articles, the collection is particularly noteworthy for the films, videocassettes, and audio reels and cassettes that Dr. Calhoun used to document his experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Calhoun papers form one of the almost 600 described research collections of the Library&amp;#39;s Modern Manuscripts program. They are one of an extensive number in human development and behavioral sciences; others include the papers of Bertram Brown, Wayne Dennis, Lawrence K. Frank, Paul MacLean, Lois Meek, Lois B. Murphy, and Herbert Rowell Stolz, as well as the records of the Society for Research in Child Development, and the American Child Guidance Clinic and Child Psychiatry Movement Interview Collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Calhoun materials may be consulted in the History of Medicine Division Reading Room, National Library of Medicine, open Monday through Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., except federal holidays on the first floor of Building 38 on the NIH campus, Bethesda, Maryland. No appointment is necessary. The finding aid to the collection may be found at &lt;a href="http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=nlmfindaid;idno=calhoun586"&gt;http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=nlmfindaid;idno=calhoun586&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest biomedical library, is a component of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="items"&gt;&lt;div class="columnA" style="width:20%;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dr. John B.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is pleased to announce the 2012-2013 year of the leadership program jointly sponsored with the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries (AAHSL). The NLM/AAHSL Leadership Fellows Program is focused on preparing emerging leaders for the position of library director in academic health sciences libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;NLM continues to be pleased with the success of this collaboration with AAHSL,&amp;#34; said NLM Director Donald A.B. Lindberg, MD. &amp;#34;Since 2002, this leadership program has been invaluable in preparing library managers who are rising stars to move into directorship positions.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AAHSL president Gary Freiburger said, &amp;#34;AAHSL is proud of this successful program, which is meeting a critical need in our libraries. As it enters its eleventh year, it has a proven track record in identifying, encouraging, and preparing future academic health sciences library directors. We are delighted to continue our partnership with NLM.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellows will have the opportunity to develop their knowledge and skills in a variety of learning settings, including exposure to leadership in another environment. They will be paired with mentors who are academic health sciences library directors. In addition to the individual relationship with their mentors, fellows benefit from working collaboratively with other fellows and mentors. Experienced program faculty and mentors will provide content and facilitation for the cohort. The program takes advantage of flexible scheduling and an online learning community to minimize disruption to professional and personal schedules. The sponsors will provide financial support for a small cohort of fellows and will underwrite travel and meeting expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty fellows have participated in the program since its inauguration in 2002. To date, 19 fellows have been appointed to director positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The program was a defining influence on my career,&amp;#34; said Brian Bunnett, fellow, class of 2003-2004, and library director at the University of New Mexico. &amp;#34;It has been eight years since I completed the program, but I will continue to benefit for the rest of my career from the contacts I made, the knowledge I gained, and the confidence it instilled in me.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beth Layton, fellow, class of 2004-2005, and library director, Northeast Ohio Medical University, said, &amp;#34;As I tackle new issues and position the library to reflect the institutional and external environment, I continue to realize how much I learned during the fellowship. I incorporate what I learned on trends and politics into planning and daily operations. I believe my institution benefits from my participation in the program.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jean Shipman, mentor, class of 2010-2011, and library director at the University of Utah, stated, &amp;#34;While you think you can&amp;#39;t afford the time, you can&amp;#39;t afford not to make the time. Through participation, you get to connect directly with nine other librarians to glean wisdom from their contexts, experience, and in-depth knowledge. If you would like permission to take time to contemplate issues key to the successful management of libraries, working with your fellow offers such an opportunity.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Program Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one-year program design is multi-faceted: three in-person leadership institutes; attendance at an Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) annual meeting; a yearlong fellow/mentor relationship; webinars and discussions on issues related to library leadership; and a two-week site visit to the mentor&amp;#39;s home library (in one- or two-week segments).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program is designed to:Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduce fellows to leadership theory and practical tools for implementing change at organizational and professional levels;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduce fellows to critical issues facing academic health sciences libraries;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop meaningful professional relationships between fellows and mentors that give fellows access to career guidance and support;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expose fellows to another academic health sciences library and its institutional leadership under the guidance of their mentors;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examine career development and provide models of directors to fellows;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a cohort of leaders who will draw upon each other for support throughout their careers;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Promote diversity in the leadership of the profession; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Offer recognition to emerging leaders and enhance the competitive standing of fellows as they pursue director positions.Â &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM/AAHSL Leadership Fellows Program is currently accepting applications and nominations for the August 1, 2012, deadline for potential fellows for the 2012-2013 experience. Candidates for fellow should have a strong interest in pursuing a directorship in academic health sciences libraries, as well as significant management experience. Applications are welcomed from professionals working in academic health sciences libraries, hospital libraries, or other library-related settings. Applications from qualified minority candidates are encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directors with at least five years&amp;#39; experience as director of an academic health sciences library should indicate preliminary interest in being matched as a mentor by contacting the AAHSL Future Leadership Committee by August 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program brochure, including information on program design, schedule, and application process, is available at &lt;a href="http://www.aahsl.org/assets/2012/2012-2013_nlm-aahsl_leadership_fellows_program.pdf"&gt;http://www.aahsl.org/assets/2012/2012-2013_nlm-aahsl_leadership_fellows_program.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) announces a funding opportunity for small projects to improve access to disaster medicine and public health information for health care professionals, first responders and others that play a role in health-related disaster preparedness, response and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM is soliciting proposals from partnerships that include at least one library &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; at least one non-library organization that has disaster-related responsibilities, includingÂ  but not limited to: local, regional or state agencies with disaster health responsibilities, such as health departments, public safety departments, emergency management departments, pre-hospital and emergency medical services, fire/rescue departments, and others; hospitals; and faith-based and voluntary organizations active in disaster activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contract awards willÂ be offered for a minimum of $15,000 to a maximum of $30,000 each for a one-year project. The deadline for proposals is Wednesday, August 8, 2012 at 2:00 PM ET. Proposals are limited to six pages plus supplemental materials such as resumes, letters of support,Â and a budget. (Please see Grant Application Information, below.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM encourages submission of innovative proposals that enhance mutually beneficial collaborations among libraries and disaster-related agencies. For example, projects may increase awareness of health information resources, demonstrate how libraries and librarians can assist planners and responders with disaster-related information needs, show ways in which disaster workers can educate librarians about disaster management, and/or include collaboration among partners in developing information resources that support planning and response to public health emergencies.Â  Summaries of the seven projectsÂ funded for 2011-2012 are at: &lt;a href="http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov/dimrc/2011disasteroutreachawards.html"&gt;http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov/dimrc/2011disasteroutreachawards.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM has a long history of providing health information to prepare for and respond to all types of disasters, and has developed a number of tools and advanced information services designed for disaster and emergency. NLM provided information for the Bhopal, India gas leak in 1984 and helped create local disaster information centers following Hurricane Mitch in Central America. NLM&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/htmlgen?HSDB"&gt;Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDBÂ®)&lt;/a&gt;, a comprehensive toxicology database, provides the framework for the &lt;a href="http://wiser.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;Wireless Information System for Emergency Responders (WISERÂ®)&lt;/a&gt;, a resource used by emergency responders to assist with the management of chemical, radiological, and biological emergencies. WISER was used in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina, and in Iraq to help identify potentially toxic substances. More recently, NLM assisted public health officials responding to H1N1 influenza, earthquakes in Haiti and Chile, the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, and the Japanese radiation event, by providing timely, evidence-based information.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grant Application Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Request for Proposal (RFP) for this requirement has been split into two solicitations; one Partial Small Business Set-Aside (RFP No.: NIHLM2012411) and; one Full and Open (RFP No.: NIHLM2012412). The solicitation notices are on FedBizOpps.gov as follows:Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Partial Small Business Set-Aside&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fbo.gov/?s=opportunity&amp;#38;mode=form&amp;#38;id=ad2bb9b6b067a1b0cb704070dbcc4f13&amp;#38;tab=core&amp;#38;_cview=0"&gt;https://www.fbo.gov/?s=opportunity&amp;#38;mode=form&amp;#38;id=ad2bb9b6b067a1b0cb704070dbcc4f13&amp;#38;tab=core&amp;#38;_cview=0&lt;/a&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Full and Open &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fbo.gov/?s=opportunity&amp;#38;mode=form&amp;#38;id=9d9f0974ab8150e88e20ef5a1fdce4b3&amp;#38;tab=core&amp;#38;_cview=0"&gt;https://www.fbo.gov/?s=opportunity&amp;#38;mode=form&amp;#38;id=9d9f0974ab8150e88e20ef5a1fdce4b3&amp;#38;tab=core&amp;#38;_cview=0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information and application instructions regarding the &amp;#34;Disaster Health Information Outreach and Collaboration Project 2012,&amp;#34; please visit: &lt;a href="http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov/dimrc/2012disasteroutreachrfp.html"&gt;http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov/dimrc/2012disasteroutreachrfp.html&lt;/a&gt;.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, has acquired a collection of over 200 books and periodical issues related to the literary achievements of the prominent&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;American Civil War surgeon S. Weir Mitchell (1829-1914).Â Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitchell obtained his medical degree in 1850 from Jefferson Medical College and spent the following year in Paris, where he studied with noted physiologist Claude Bernard, who invented the concept of blind experiments to ensure objectivity in scientific observations. During the American Civil War, Mitchell was a surgeon at Turner&amp;#39;s Lane Hospital in Philadelphia, where he treated many patients with nerve injuries. This work eventually led to his interest in neurology and neuropsychiatry. After the war, Mitchell returned to private practice. In 1870, he was appointed physician-in-charge of the Department for Nervous Diseases of the Philadelphia Orthopedic Hospital, where he would treat patients for over 40 years.Â Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An accomplished surgeon, Mitchell published over 100 scientific articles and monographs during his lifetime. His medical background and experience enabled him to write historical fiction with much psychological insight. He published more than 25 literary titles, many of which are represented in NLM&amp;#39;s new acquisition, alongside dozens of volumes signed by Mitchell and various editions which document changes in styles and tastes of American publishing of the period.Â Â  Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Mitchell&amp;#39;s literary works now held by the NLM is an 1864 monograph entitled &lt;em&gt;The Children&amp;#39;s Hour&lt;/em&gt;, which he co-wrote with poet Elizabeth Wister Stevenson to aid the Sanitary Commission Fair in Philadelphia. Three years later, he published &lt;em&gt;The Wonderful Stories of Fuz-Buz the Fly and Mother Grabem the Spider&lt;/em&gt;, another book for children. His first literary work for adults, which was printed in the July 1866 issue of &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic Monthly,&lt;/em&gt; was &amp;#34;The Case of George Dedlow,&amp;#34; a fictional account of a Civil War soldier who had lost all of his limbs. &lt;em&gt;Hill of Stones&lt;/em&gt;, his first book of poems, was published in 1883, and his first full-length novel, &lt;em&gt;In War Time&lt;/em&gt;, followed in 1885. &lt;em&gt;Hugh Wynne, Free Quaker, Sometime Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel on the Staff of His Excellency General Washington&lt;/em&gt;, an historical novel&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;set during the Revolutionary War, is the best known and most successful of his novels. However, &lt;em&gt;The Adventures of FranÃ§ois, Foundling, Thief, Juggler, and Fencing-Master, During the French Revolution&lt;/em&gt; was the author&amp;#39;s favorite of his own books, according to scholars of the period.Â Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S. Weir Mitchell collection of the NLM will be digitized over the next two years as part of NLM&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/americas/introduction.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medicine in the Americas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a digital library project that makes freely available original works demonstrating the evolution of American medicine from colonial frontier outposts of the 17th century to research hospitals of the 20th century. &lt;em&gt;Medicine in the Americas&lt;/em&gt; itself is made possible in part through the participation of the NLM in the &lt;a href="http://www.medicalheritage.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Medical Heritage Library&lt;/a&gt;, a digital curation collaborative supported by &lt;a href="http://www.neh.gov/"&gt;The National Endowment for the Humanities&lt;/a&gt;, The &lt;a href="http://www.sloan.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Alfred P.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM will host the SPL Working Group&amp;#39;s SPLIMAGE Workshop, to be held at the NLM Boardroom in Bethesda, MD on July 26, 2012, 10 AM to 4 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In recent years, NLM has been working toward developing the methods and infrastructure for digital photographs of prescription oral solid dose medications (prescription pills, tablets, and capsules). Â A complete, comprehensive portfolio of the nation&amp;#39;s prescription formulary would have a profound impact on consumer safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On May 23, 2011, NLM posted a Federal Register Notice (Vol. 76, No. 99, FR Doc. 2011-12629, &lt;a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-05-23/html/2011-12629.htm"&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-05-23/html/2011-12629.htm&lt;/a&gt;), seeking sources of medications to develop the photographic techniques to capture this information.Â Â In June 2012, the first results of an ongoing study of digital photographs of voluntarily submitted medications by pharmaceutical manufacturers were released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, the Structured Product Labeling (SPL) Working Group Leadership Team is convening a meeting to gather information about the process and techniques on digital photography and data acquisition. Â Topics to be discussed include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Digital Photography of SPLIMAGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="unIndentedList"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Methodology&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Results&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demonstration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early Experience with the SPLIMAGE data - Respondents to the NLM FR NoticeÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="unIndentedList"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sponsors perspective(s)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DailyMed &amp;#38; possible downstream uses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Workflow discussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="unIndentedList"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use of the SPLIMAGE specification outside of NLM photography&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Updated sample provision process?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Possible issues and concerns&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the meeting is an open forum of the SPL Working Group, space in the room is limited. Â Specific invitations have been made to a number ofÂ sponsors (including all those who provided samples in response to the May 2011 Federal Register notice), FDAÂ representatives involved with SPL and the SPLIMAGE discussions, NLM representatives involved with the SPLIMAGEÂ image production and dissemination, and potential downstream users of the SPLIMAGEs as they become available.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcomes from the discussions will be disseminated via the usual SPL Working group communication channels (SPL Working Group WIKI, cascades through e-mail, LinkedIn, presentations at SPL WG subteam meetings, and potentially others).Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note that the content of the meeting is the subject of the organizers and is not representative of NLM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"&gt;If you have any questions about the meeting or if you would like to attend, contact the SPL Working Group Leadership Team through Terry BrunoneÂ (&lt;a href="mailto:Theresa.M.Brunone@gsk.com"&gt;Theresa.M.Brunone@gsk.com&lt;/a&gt;).Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;

NLM is the world&amp;#39;s largest biomedical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ground-breaking achievement in computational biology earned the cover of the July 20, 2012 issue of &lt;a href="http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2812%2900776-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and represents a &amp;#34;&lt;a href="http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2012/pr-computer-model-organism-071812.html"&gt;transforming approach to answering questions about fundamental biological processes&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#34; according to James M. Anderson, MD, PhD, director of NIH&amp;#39;s Division of Program Coordination, Planning and Strategic Initiatives. The single-cell bacterium was chosen for its relative simplicity; it has 525 genes, compared to E. coli&amp;#39;s 4,288. The model runs on 128 computers and:Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describes the life cycle of a single cell from the level of individual molecules and their interactions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accounts for the specific function of every annotated gene product&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accurately predicts a wide range of observable behaviors&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="picture left"&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Cover of the 7/20/12 issue of Cell, showing a chalkboard full of mathematical equations and diagrams " src="/news/CELL_cover.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cover of the 7/20/12 issue of &lt;/em&gt;Cell&lt;em&gt;, showing a chalkboard &lt;br /&gt;full of mathematical equations and diagrams used in a computer&lt;br /&gt; model of Mycoplasma genitalium.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/21/science/in-a-first-an-entire-organism-is-simulated-by-software.html?_r=2"&gt;July 20, 2012 article in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Covert described the object-oriented approach his team used to design the 28 separate modules that represent &lt;em&gt;M. genitalium&amp;#39;s &lt;/em&gt;biological processes: &amp;#34;The major modeling insight we had a few years ago was to break up the functionality of the cell into subgroups, which we could model individually, each with its own mathematics, and then to integrate these submodels together into a whole.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach uses more than 1,900 parameters observed experimentally and reported in 900+ articles, and integrates them in a manner that enables understanding and provides direction for real-world experiments. &amp;#34;If you use a model to guide your experiments, you&amp;#39;re going to discover things faster. We&amp;#39;ve shown that time and time again,&amp;#34; said Covert. NIH&amp;#39;s Anderson is clear on the significance: &amp;#34;&lt;a href="http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2012/pr-computer-model-organism-071812.html"&gt;Comprehensive computer models of entire cells have the potential to advance our understanding of cellular function and, ultimately, to inform new approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of disease&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To read the full article by Dr. Covert and team:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Karr JR, Sanghvi JC, Macklin DN, Gutschow MV, Jacobs JM, Bolival B Jr, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assad-Garcia N, Glass JI, Covert MW.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is pleased to announce its first initiative as part of its recently-established partnership with the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) (&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/partnership_nlm_neh.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/partnership_nlm_neh.html&lt;/a&gt;), which lays groundwork for the two institutions to cooperate on initiatives of common interest. NLM, a component of the National Institutes of Health, is the world&amp;#39;s largest biomedical library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working in cooperation with the NEH&amp;#39;s Office of Digital Humanities (&lt;a href="http://www.neh.gov/odh/"&gt;http://www.neh.gov/odh/&lt;/a&gt;); Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities at the University of Maryland (&lt;a href="http://mith.umd.edu/"&gt;http://mith.umd.edu&lt;/a&gt;); and Research Councils UK (&lt;a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/"&gt;http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/&lt;/a&gt;), the NLM will be a part of &amp;#34;Shared Horizons: Data, Biomedicine, and the Digital Humanities,&amp;#34; an interdisciplinary symposium exploring the intersection of digital humanities and biomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scheduled to take place April 10-12, 2013, Shared Horizons will be a unique forum through which participants and their institutions will be able to address questions about collaboration, research methodologies, and the interpretation of evidence arising from the interdisciplinary opportunities in this burgeoning area of biomedical-driven humanities scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shared Horizons will create opportunities for disciplinary cross-fertilization through a mix of formal and informal presentations combined with breakout sessions, all designed to promote a rich exchange of ideas about how large-scale quantitative methods can lead to new understandings of human culture. Bringing together researchers from the digital humanities and bioinformatics communities, the symposium willÂ  explore ways in which these two communities might fruitfully collaborate on projects that bridge the humanities and medicine around the topics of sequence alignment and network analysis, two modes of analysis that intersect with &amp;#34;big data.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, including the call for attendees, please visit: &lt;a href="http://www.mith.umd.edu/sharedhorizons/"&gt;http://www.mith.umd.edu/sharedhorizons/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="logo_group"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;&lt;img alt="National Library of Medicine" class="margin_image" src="/news/NLM-HHS-LOGO.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.neh.gov/"&gt;&lt;img alt="National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)" class="margin_image" src="/news/neh_logo_horizontal_rgb.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://mith.umd.edu"&gt;&lt;img alt="Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities at the University of Maryland" class="margin_image" src="/news/mithlogo_ext_blk.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk"&gt;&lt;img alt="Research Councils UK" class="margin_image" src="/news/rcukusa130px.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;####&lt;/p&gt;

JATS is a continuation of work done at the National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) to create and support the NLM Archiving and Interchange Tag Suite, commonly referred to as &amp;#34;the NLM DTDs.&amp;#34; A DTD or Document Type Definition is a set of markup declarations that define a document type for a Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-family markup language, such as XML and HTML.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JATS is a standard markup model for publishing, authoring, and archiving journal articles and other documents. It defines elements and attributes for describing textual and graphical content of journal articles and other materials, which allows publishers and archives to preserve the intellectual content of journals independent of the form in which that content was originally delivered. In addition to the element and attribute descriptions, JATS includes three journal article tag sets: the Archiving and Interchange Tag Set, the Journal Publishing Tag Set, and the Article Authoring Tag Set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally developed as the data structure for journals participating in NCBI&amp;#39;s PubMed Central archive of life sciences literature, the Tag Suite has achieved strong acceptance among publishers and authors, with more than 70% of publisher content deposited into PubMed Central currently arriving in the standard format. The Tag Suite also has been adopted by the Portico and Highwire Press archives, the British Library, and the Library of Congress for electronic journal articles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information about JATS is available at NLM&amp;#39;s JATS Web site (&lt;a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;http://jats.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest biomedical library, is a component of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, is pleased to announce a new special display, &lt;em&gt;Pick Your Poison: Intoxicating Pleasures and Medical Prescriptions.&lt;/em&gt; This unique project, featuring items from the National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s historical collection as well as the National Museum of American History in Washington, DC, is open to the public in the History of Medicine Division Reading Room (Building 38, first floor), on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland, through October 11, 2013. Visitors are welcome between 8:30 AM and 5:00 PM weekdays except federal holidays.ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mind-altering drugs have been used throughout the history of America. While some remain socially acceptable, such as alcohol, others, like heroin and cocaine, are now outlawed because of their toxic, and intoxicating, characteristics. These classifications have shifted at different times in history, and they will continue to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transformation of a particular drug, from an acceptable indulgence or medical treatment to a bad habit, or vice versa, is closely tied to the intentions and their status in society of those endorsing its use. Yet these substances have often served the same ends whether administered for prescription or for pleasureÃ¢ÂÂto treat pain and illness, to ease the hardships of work and daily life, or to feed an addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pick Your Poison&lt;/em&gt; explores some of the factors that have shaped the changing definition of some of our most potent drugs in a special display featuring rare books and ephemera from the collection of the National Library of Medicine, historic artifacts from the National Museum of American History, and photographs from the Library of Congress.ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with this special display, the History of Medicine Division Lecture Series presented a lectureÃÂ by Frederick W. Gibbs, PhD, Assistant Professor of History, Department of History and Art History and Director of Digital Scholarship, Center for History and New Media at George Mason University,ÃÂ titled &amp;#34;&amp;#39;The Venoms Doo Cure the Diseases:&amp;#39; Separating Poison and Medicine in Early Modern Europe.&amp;#34; The lecture took place in the Lister Hill Auditorium, Building 38A on Wednesday, September 26, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a tour of the special display at NLM in Bethesda, please contact: &lt;a href="mailto:NLMExhibition@mail.nih.gov"&gt;NLMExhibition@mail.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;; or call 301.594.1947.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="items"&gt;&lt;div class="columnA" style="width:45%;"&gt;&lt;div class="picture left"&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Advertisement for the invigorating benefits of Burdock Blood Bitters, ca. 1880" height="372" src="/news/burdock.jpg" width="276" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertisement for the invigorating benefits of Burdock Blood Bitters, ca. 1880&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Courtesy National Library of Medicine&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturers of patent medicines, which were sold directly to the public, marketed temperance drinks as healthful tonics good for everything from restoring youthful energy to treating malaria.

Following the introduction of the hypodermic syringe, brought to America in 1856, morphine use and addiction increased. Doctors injected middle- and upper-class women for the treatment of so-called female troubles, such as nervousness and lethargy.

Users will now have access to new and reorganized content about clinical research, background information about the site, search tools, and help for those maintaining study records. Core content and functions of the ClinicalTrials.gov site - including the basic and advanced search, search results options, and the study record data - remain the same. The re-design was undertaken to meet the needs of the many different users of the site, including patients, clinicians, researchers, and the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov is the NLM-developed Web-based registry and results database of clinical research studies. Launched in 2000, the Web site provides patients, clinicians, researchers, and the public with access to information about interventional and observational studies. Today, ClinicalTrials.gov provides information on more than 133,000 clinical research studies in all 50 states and in 179 countries. The site receives more than 95 million page views per month and 60,000 unique visitors daily.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its creation, ClinicalTrials.gov has expanded in terms of scope, features and intended audiences, in response to the evolving policies and laws promoting the reporting of clinical trial information.Â Â  For example, Congress enacted legislation in 2007 that added the first public results database. As a result, summary information about clinical trials of US Food and Drug Administration-approved medical products would be publicly available, whether or not the results were published in the medical literature. New user interface features in ClinicalTrials.gov were launched in 2008 to display the results data tables and allow for searching of studies with results. (For details, see &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/so08/so08_clinicaltrials.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov to Include Basic Results Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) Over time, the Web site has featured the American Customer Satisfaction Index survey tool to collect feedback from users and usability evaluations have been conducted.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, announces the release of a new Turning the Pages virtual book on its &lt;a href="http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/v2/books/#!/andrew-snapes-anatomy-of-an-horse/"&gt;Web site&lt;/a&gt;, via &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/turning-the-pages-ttp/id423830194?mt=8"&gt;iPad App&lt;/a&gt;, and in kiosks onsite at the NLM. Â The new project features selections from &lt;em&gt;The Anatomy of an Horse&lt;/em&gt;, by Andrew Snape, farrier to King Charles II of England and a self-described member of a dynasty of royal farriers stretching back over two centuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Printed in London in 1683, &lt;em&gt;The Anatomy of an Horse&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most comprehensive and beautifully illustrated books about horses published in seventeenth-century Britain. It contains numerous engravings of horses, mainly on the dissecting table, including the digestive system, heart, brain, musculature and the skeleton. Turning the Pages features a selection of these images curated by NLM staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farriers were generally blacksmiths whose primary duty was making shoes for horses and applying them to the animals&amp;#39; feet, but they often took on other tasks in horse care as well, including treating illnesses such as the glanders (a common equine sinus infection), the botts (a parasite), or lameness. They also applied surgical remedies for horses such as purgatives and bloodletting.Â  Farriers were usually illiterate tradespeople who learned their craft through an apprenticeship and &amp;#34;practiced&amp;#34; in the military&amp;#39;s cavalry, on a gentleman&amp;#39;s estate, or in a village or town.Â  Until the prevalence of the automobile, horses were some of the most important animals to humans, providing transportation, battle power, and heft. Horses were often the most valuable possession of a middle class family, and were considered a powerful symbol of prestige among the wealthy, nobility, and gentry.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched at the NLM in 2001, Turning the Pages is part of an ongoing collaboration between research engineers at the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications and curators and historians at the NLM&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division, to help make its rare and unique history of medicine materials widely available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM holds one of the world&amp;#39;s largest collections of early books relating to veterinary medicine dating before the year 1800. Individuals and groups with an interest in the history of veterinary medicine, or in the history of horse care, are warmly welcome to visit the NLM&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division of the Library to view or use these materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, or to schedule a visit to NLM&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division, please call 301.402.8878.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="items"&gt;&lt;div class="columnA" style="width:62%;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Engraving of a horse by Nicholas Yeates (active 1669-1683) in Andrew Snape&amp;#39;s The Anatomy of an Horse, printed in London in 1683." src="/news/05-horse-light-large.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/snape-gallery-files/05-horse-light-large.jpg"&gt;http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/snape-gallery-files/05-horse-light-large.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engraving of a horse by Nicholas Yeates (active 1669-1683) in Andrew Snape&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Anatomy of an Horse&lt;/em&gt;, printed in London in 1683.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy National Library of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnB" style="width:33%;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Engraving showing two horses heads with brain exposed, from Andrew Snape&amp;#39;s The Anatomy of an Horse, printed in London in 1683." src="/news/13-horse-head-large.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/snape-gallery-files/13-horse-head-large.jpg"&gt;http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/snape-gallery-files/13-horse-head-large.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engraving showing two horses heads with brain exposed, from Andrew Snape&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Anatomy of an Horse&lt;/em&gt;, printed in London in 1683.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy National Library of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM), in collaboration with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and Centers for Medicare &amp;#38; Medicaid Services (CMS), has launched the NLM &lt;a href="https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)&lt;/a&gt;. Initially the VSAC will provide downloadable access to all official versions of vocabulary value sets contained in the 2014 Clinical Quality Measures. The value sets provide lists of the numerical values and individual names from standard vocabularies used to define the clinical concepts (e.g. diabetes, clinical visit) used in the quality measures. The content of the VSAC will gradually expand to incorporate value sets for other use cases, as well as for new measures and updates to existing measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access to the Value Set Authority Center requires a free &lt;a href="https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/license.html"&gt;Unified Medical Language SystemÃÂ® Metathesaurus License&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM launch of the VSAC coincides with the CMS posting of the official &lt;a href="http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/2014_ClinicalQualityMeasures.html"&gt;2014 Meaningful Use Clinical Quality Measures (CQMs)&lt;/a&gt;.

The Library is selecting Web content as part of its mission to collect, preserve, and make accessible the scholarly biomedical literature as well as resources that illustrate a diversity of philosophical and cultural perspectives not found in the technical literature. New forms of publication on the Web, such as blogs authored by doctors and patients, illuminate health care thought and practice in the 21st century. In launching this initiative, the Library is capturing and providing a unique resource for future scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Library&amp;#39;s inaugural collection of Web content is &amp;#34;Health and Medicine Blogs,&amp;#34; presenting the perspectives of physicians, nurses, hospital administrators and other individuals in health care fields. The collection also includes patients chronicling their experiences with conditions such as cancer, diabetes and arthritis. The site currently contains 12 blogs, including KevinMD.com, &amp;#34;social media&amp;#39;s leading physician voice&amp;#34;; Not Running a Hospital, a blog by a former CEO of a large Boston hospital; e-patient Dave, a cancer survivor and leader in the participatory medicine movement; and Wheelchair Kamikaze, who writes about his personal experience living with multiple sclerosis (MS).Â For more information and access to the collection see &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/webcollecting"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/webcollecting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guided by the NLM Collection Development Manual and other strategic collecting efforts, NLM will continue to expand its capacity to collect Web content. With this initiative NLM has taken a major new step in its mission to collect pertinent health care information of today for the benefit of research in the future. Increasingly, that information is found on the Web, which is a rapidly changing environment where valuable and interesting materials can surface and then quickly disappear. The Library is working to ensure it can effectively collect new material in a Web environment, and guarantee the material&amp;#39;s permanence and availability to current and future patrons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In launching this initiative, NLM joins many other national, state and public libraries and archives that have acknowledged the importance of preserving Web content for future generations. In addition to the Internet Archive, which has been broadly archiving the Web since 1996, dozens of libraries and cultural heritage institutions have been engaged in thematic or event-based collecting. This community has contributed to the development and use of common tools, techniques, and standards that enable the creation of Web archives. NLM has benefitted from this work and from local partners such as the Library of Congress, which is actively engaged in collecting and preserving Web content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM has already been archiving portions of its own Web domain considered to be of enduring value. With this new effort, the Library is now collecting Web content that others have created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information please contact &lt;a href="http://apps.nlm.nih.gov/mainweb/siebel/nlm/index.cfm"&gt;The National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;a href="http://epatientdave.com/"&gt;&lt;img alt="e Patient Dave" src="/news/epatientdave_new3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot from the blog of Dave deBronkart, known as &amp;#34;e-patient Dave,&amp;#34; at &lt;a href="http://epatientdave.com/"&gt;http://epatientdave.com/&lt;/a&gt;.

    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Papers of Louis Sokoloff, Noted NIH/NIMH Researcher, and Updated Guide to Mental Health Motion Pictures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM), the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library, announces two new resources for the study of mental health history: the papers of Louis Sokoloff (b. 1921), a noted neurochemical researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), a component of the National Institutes of Health, and an updated, &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/collections/films/mentalhealthguide/index.html"&gt;online Guide to Mental Health Motion Pictures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1957 until his retirement more than 40 years later, Sokoloff served as Chief of Cerebral Metabolism at the NIMH. In 1981 he won the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Research for developing methods of measuring metabolic activity that led to development of positron-emission tomography for the brain. Donated by Dr. Sokoloff himself, the Sokoloff collection comprises materials from 1953 to 2004. In addition to laboratory notebooks and drafts of articles, the collection is particularly noteworthy for the radiographs that Dr. Sokoloff used as part of the development of his imaging techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sokoloff papers constitute one of nearly six hundred processed modern manuscript collections at the Library. For the benefit of researchers, educators, and students, these collections are described in the &lt;a href="http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=nlmfindaid;page=browse" target="_blank"&gt;Library&amp;#39;s finding aids database&lt;/a&gt;, and may be used in the History of Medicine Division reading room. A finding aid to the Sokoloff collection is available &lt;a href="http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/sokoloff591" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM&amp;#39;s updated, &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/collections/films/mentalhealthguide/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;online Guide to Mental Health Motion Pictures&lt;/a&gt;, provides information covering over 200 films and video recordings produced from the 1930s through 1970, including links from each title to NLM&amp;#39;s catalog record. The films show the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders as defined at the time they were made. The productions range from ideological, documentary, educational, and training films to military-produced titles explaining the psychological impact of war. The therapies shown range widely, from insulin-shock and electroconvulsive therapies and surgical approaches such as lobotomy, to the mid-twentieth-century revolution in pharmaceutical intervention. The films also document the therapeutic shift towards community-based mental health. Among the titles presented is&lt;em&gt; Let There Be Light&lt;/em&gt;, a 1946 film by director John Huston. This film was withheld from public distribution for 35 years because of its frank depiction of psychological trauma among combat veterans. In 2010, &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/let_there_be_light_film.html" target="_blank"&gt;this film was named to the National Film Registry&lt;/a&gt;, which documents films of significant cultural, historical, or aesthetic value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guide is enriched by a Viewshare-generated interactive timeline linked to production dates. &lt;a href="http://viewshare.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Viewshare&lt;/a&gt; is a service provided by the Library of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of its ongoing efforts to provide greater access to its collections, the Library plans to digitize selected titles from the Guide over the next several years and make them available through its Digital Collections repository and other online, curated projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;em&gt; Guide to Mental Health Motion Pictures&lt;/em&gt; joins previous NLM subject guides to films, notably the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/collections/films/tropicalguide/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guide to Tropical Disease Motion Pictures and Audiovisuals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2009), and the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/pdf/motionpicture.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s Motion Pictures and Videocassettes about the Public Health Service and Its Agencies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1998).Â NLM&amp;#39;s audiovisual collection includes over 30,000 titles and is the foremost medical film archive in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="items"&gt;&lt;div class="columnA" style="width:29%;"&gt;&lt;p style="float:left; width: 300px; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dr. Louis Sokoloff in 1981, at the time of the Awarding of the Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award." src="/news/sokoloff_portrait.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Louis Sokoloff in 1981, at the time of the Awarding of the Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnB" style="width:66%;"&gt;&lt;p style="width: 600px; text-align: justify; padding-left: 2em"&gt;&lt;img alt="A soldier speaks to a comrade experiencing combat stress.

    <body>&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;What&amp;#39;s the perfect (and free) holiday gift for those with tablets and other computers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;The National Library of Medicine suggests PubReader, an innovative, reader-friendly interface that helps users read and digest articles in PubMed Central (PMC), NLM&amp;#39;s full-text archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature. PubReader was developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, a component of NLM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;PubReader was created in order to keep pace with the continuing advances in Web technology, enhancing the readability of PMC journal articles not only on small-screen devices, but also on desktops and laptops.Â  PubReader can be accessed from all major Web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&amp;#34;Why is it that we can spend hours reading e-mails, news articles, blogs, and abstracts on our computers,&amp;#34; wrote NCBI Director Dr. David Lipman in a recent &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/nd12/nd12_pubreader.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;#34;but when it comes to a scientific article, many of us choose to print it out? Perhaps it is because we generally do not read straight through an article. Instead, we often glance back at a table, figure, or paragraph to clarify what we have just read. The more complicated the article, the more likely we are to flip back and forth while reading it. Printed articles typically break the content into two columns per printed page, which, together with embedded figures and tables, provides convenient physical and visual landmarks for facilitating this form of reading.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;NCBI has combined the best features of a print article into PubReader. Like a printed paper, PubReader breaks an article into multiple columns and pages to improve readability and navigation. PubReader can expand a page to whatever fits on your screen-with multiple columns on a desktop monitor or a single column page on a small tablet. It will even switch to two columns if you rotate the tablet to a landscape view. When you adjust the font size or change the size of the browser window, page boundaries and columns are adjusted automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;PubReader also provides an image strip at the bottom of the page with thumbnails of all figures and tables in the article so that you can pop up an earlier figure/table and then close it in an instant without losing your place in the article. This same feature works with inline figures, tables and citations as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Key features of PubReader include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clean, easy to read, multi-column display. Nothing to distract you from the task of reading an article.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Access from whatever device you are using: desktop, laptop or tablet. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple navigation options. On a tablet, flip the pages as you would with a book. Or tap/click the edges, use the arrow keys, page up/down keys, the scrollbar; it&amp;#39;s all up to you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Figures at your fingertips. Activate the figure strip to have access to all figures, no matter where you are in the article.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supported by all major platforms and browsers. See the complete &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/pr-browsers/"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;How can you try out PubReader? The new view is available for any article that appears in full-text HTML form in PMC. It is not available for older content that is available only in PDF form or as scanned images of the original print pages. You can get to the new view directly from an article citation in a search result list or an issue table of contents:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Â &lt;img alt="PubReader Action Text" height="119" src="/news/citation.jpg" width="383" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Or from the Formats links in the top right corner of an article page in PMC:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;img alt="PubReader Action Text" height="82" src="/news/formats.jpg" width="394" /&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;To learn more about PubReader:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/pubreader/"&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/pubreader/&lt;/a&gt; Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library, is a component of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

Inouye" src="/news/inouye_portrait.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right:30px; margin-bottom:5ps" /&gt;Former United States Senator Daniel K. Inouye died December 17, 2012 of respiratory complications. He was 88.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respected for his leadership in civil rights, disability rights, and health care, Inouye was the President pro tempore of the Senate from 2010 until his death, making him third in the presidential line of succession after the Vice President and Speaker of the House of Representatives. A senator since 1963, Inouye was the most senior senator at the time of his death and the second-longest serving US Senator in history, after Robert Byrd. He was also the highest-ranking Asian American politician in US history. He continuously represented Hawaii in the US Congress since it achieved statehood in 1959, serving as the state&amp;#39;s first US Representative from 1959 to 1963. He was also a recipient of the Medal of Honor for his heroism during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Inouye came to national attention during his service on the Senate Watergate Committee. Inouye was also involved in the Iran-Contra investigations of the 1980s, chairing a special committee from 1987 to 1989. The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, in its obituary, called Sen. Inouye &amp;#34;the quiet voice of national conscience&amp;#34; during those historic hearings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other Senate leadership positions, he chaired the Committee on Indian Affairs from 1987 to 1995 and from 2001 to 2003. He was also chairman of the Committee on Appropriations from 2009 until his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his knowledge of Native American affairs and his close involvement with Native Hawaiian culture, Sen. Inouye is featured in the NLM exhibition, &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Native Voices: Native Peoples&amp;#39; Concepts of Health and Illness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, currently on view in Bethesda, Maryland and also online. Exhibition content can also be viewed via a free iPad app, available by searching &amp;#34;NLM Native Voices&amp;#34; on the &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/"&gt;Apple iTunes Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2011 interview for &lt;em&gt;Native Voices&lt;/em&gt; with NLM Director Dr. Donald Lindberg, Sen. Inouye expressed his concern about improving the health and well-being of Native Hawaiians and all Americans. He also discussed the success in Hawaii of blending traditional healing with Western medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This and other excerpts of his interview appear at: &lt;a href="http://wsearch.nlm.nih.gov/vivisimo/cgi-bin/query-meta?v%3Aproject=native-voice&amp;#38;query=Inouye"&gt;http://wsearch.nlm.nih.gov/vivisimo/cgi-bin/query-meta?v%3Aproject=native-voice&amp;#38;query=Inouye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Located in Bethesda, Maryland, the National Library of Medicine, a component of the National Institutes of Health, is the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Students will work on Cultural Heritage and Digitization Projects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Institute of Museum and Library Services has announced that NLM is a partner with two institutions in supporting the hands-on education of library science students in leadership development; and in the management and preservation of 21st century cultural heritage institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Association of Research Libraries, NLM is a partner in providing a host site for library school students to complete a fellowship that offers exposure to the management and operations of a research library. The fellowship, available to graduate students from traditionally underrepresented ethnic and racial minority groups, supports six-week internships where students are provided hands-on projects, introduction to the issues facing libraries and extensive mentoring and leadership development, priming them for careers in research libraries. Two fellows will be joining NLM in the summer of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership with Catholic University of America will support internships for students in its Cultural Heritage Information Management concentration. Students will be educated in the organization, management, and preservation of materials. The internship at NLM will provide the hands-on education needed to develop skills in selection of materials for preservation; choices in the arena of digitization; and decisions to be made in accessibility and presentation of objects both physically and in the online environment. Students are expected to join NLM for internships beginning summer 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional information can be found at the IMLS site: &lt;a href="http://www.imls.gov/news/lb21_grant_announcement.aspx#DC"&gt;http://www.imls.gov/news/lb21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Under a recent agreement with the American Medical Association (AMA), the National Library of Medicine will be including the AMA&amp;#39;s Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for molecular pathology tests in the National Institutes of Health&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/"&gt;Genetic Testing Registry (GTR&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GTR, which is operated by NLM&amp;#39;s National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), is an NIH resource for comprehensive information about genetic tests. The database provides a central location for voluntary submission of test information by providers. Content includes the test&amp;#39;s purpose, methodology, validity, evidence of the test&amp;#39;s usefulness, and laboratory contacts and credentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new agreement, AMA&amp;#39;s CPT codes for molecular pathology tests will be integrated into GTR. The AMA-created codes describe the latest advances in genetic testing and molecular diagnostic services for reporting and tracking purposes.Â  AMA&amp;#39;s new, more detailed CPT codes for molecular pathology became effective in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inclusion of the CPT codes in GTR further enhances the database&amp;#39;s interoperability with electronic medical records and laboratory information management systems. GTR also incorporates SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms), an extensive clinical terminology produced by the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation (IHTSDO), and LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes), produced by the Regenstrief Institute, which provides standardized terms and codes for identifying laboratory and clinical observations.Â  NLM is the US Member of the IHTSDO and provides support for the development and free US-wide use of both SNOMED CT and LOINC.Â  CPT, SNOMED CT, and LOINC are required standards in the certification criteria for electronic health record products issued by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;Every necessary care and attention&amp;#34;: George Washington and Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bethesda, MarylandÃ¢ÂÂThe National Library of Medicine and the Alexandria Waterfront Museum will host a special traveling banner exhibition exploring the Colonial-era healing practices used by George Washington on the battlefield, during his presidency, and home at his beloved Virginia estate. Co-produced by the National Library of Medicine (a division of the National Institutes of Health), and George WashingtonÃ¢ÂÂs Mount Vernon, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;Every necessary care and attention&amp;#34;: George Washington and Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, features a compelling collection of images and rich online companion resources drawn from the worldÃ¢ÂÂs largest medical library and the nationÃ¢ÂÂs oldest historic preservation organization. Before embarking on a national tour, the exhibition will be on display at the History of Medicine Division Reading Room, National Library of Medicine, on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland, January 30, 2013 to March 1, 2013 and at the Alexandria Waterfront Museum in Alexandria, Virginia, from January 17, 2013 to April 27, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As head of household, plantation owner, businessman, Revolutionary War general, and president, George Washington had many different concerns and responsibilities, from running his estate to ensuring the stability of a new nation. Alongside the traditional demands of political life and military leadership, he focused considerable attention on the health and safety of his family, staff, slaves, and troops, including inoculation against smallpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WashingtonÃ¢ÂÂs status and wealth gave himÃ¢ÂÂand his communityÃ¢ÂÂspecial privileges. During his lifetime, with the practice of medicine slowly becoming a licensed profession, he could call on a growing class of experts and new knowledge about the spread and prevention of disease. Even so, Washington, like everyone else of his era, encountered the limits of medicine when faced with serious illnesses such as smallpox, malaria, and tuberculosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banner display incorporates the use of QR codes allowing visitors to access transcripts and audio recordings of some key documents. The online companion exhibition (&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/georgewashington"&gt;www.nlm.nih.gov/georgewashington&lt;/a&gt;) features educational resources for K-12 teachers and students and a higher education module for professors and undergraduates. In addition, the online exhibition showcases a &amp;#34;Digital Gallery,&amp;#34; a collection of digitized books, pamphlets, and illustrations about Colonial-era medicine, healing practices, and medical practitioners from the History of Medicine Division collections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;Every necessary care and attention&amp;#34;: George Washington and Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; marks the first formal collaboration between the National Library of Medicine and Mount Vernon. The exhibition was curated by Mary V. Thompson, Dawn Bonner, and Michele R. Lee from Mount Vernon. The banner exhibition was designed by Howard + Revis Design Services. The website was designed by Link Studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After its display in the Washington, D.C. metro area at the National Library of Medicine and the Alexandria Waterfront Museum, the exhibition is expected to travel to other venues throughout the country. For more information about booking the exhibition, please contact.ÃÂ  &lt;a href="mailto:nlmtravelingexhibits@mail.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;nlmtravelingexhibits@mail.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt; or visit the traveling exhibition web site at: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/about/exhibition/georgewashington-bookinfo.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/about/exhibition/georgewashington-bookinfo.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="items"&gt;&lt;div class="columnA" style="width:45%;"&gt;&lt;div class="picture left"&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart, ca. 1798" height="190" src="/news/GW.JPG" width="176" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;George Washington by Gilbert Stuart, ca. 1798&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtesy Mount Vernon LadiesÃ¢ÂÂ Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During WashingtonÃ¢ÂÂs life (1732-1799), medicine in America followed the practices of England These practices were defined by speculative hypotheses, domestic remedies, and the beginnings of scientific investigation and formal education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnB" style="width:50%;"&gt;&lt;div class="picture left"&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt="Etching of George Washington lying in bed with two doctors standing by" src="/news/GW_deathbed.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Washington in His Last Illness attended by Docrs.

Washington began to inoculate and quarantine troops to control and minimize the impact of the disease. His decision was bold and dangerous, as inoculation brought risk of death, although far less frequently than if contracting smallpox naturally. &lt;a href="/news/GWletter_large.JPG"&gt;Larger Image&lt;/a&gt; (1,200 x 1,950 pixels)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="items"&gt;&lt;div class="columnA" style="width:45%;"&gt;&lt;div class="picture left" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="1700s Medicine Chest with glass bottles " src="/news/GW_medicine_chest.JPG" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medicine chest, typically containing glass bottles of medicine for common disorders, a set of scales, and a mortar and pestle, 1700s &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtesy Mount Vernon LadiesÃ¢ÂÂ Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;George Washington and his family members bought a wide variety of patent medicines as well as ingredients for homemade medications, including ipecacuana, diascordium, tincture of myrrh, and spirits of lavender. Having these supplies on hand would have been useful for treating family members and slaves before a doctor was called.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnB" style="width:50%;"&gt;&lt;div class="picture right"&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ &lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt="Set of dentures" src="/news/GW_dentures.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dentures owned by George Washington, ca. 1790Ã¢ÂÂ1799 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtesy Mount Vernon LadiesÃ¢ÂÂ Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;The Washingtons utilized the services of dentists, and purchased toothbrushes and tooth powders.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;African-American surgeon Charles R. Drew (1904-1950) organized and directed America&amp;#39;s first large-scale blood bank program during the early years of World War II. He also worked tirelessly to provide access to medical training to African American students, and to improve the quality of that training. The Charles R. Drew Papers on Profiles in Science makes available an extensive selection of digitized documents and visual materials about and by Dr. Drew, in collaboration with the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center at Howard University, which holds the original papers. Dr. Drew&amp;#39;s life and legacy add unique perspectives and rich historical materials to the study of history of African Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now available from the National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, is a new suite of educational resources for &lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Collection/CID/BG"&gt;The Charles R. Drew Papers&lt;/a&gt; on the National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/display/Main"&gt;Profiles in ScienceÂ®&lt;/a&gt; Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These new resources offer hands-on activities for students to explore the challenges and achievements of Dr. Drew&amp;#39;s life, by examining primary and secondary sources from The Charles R. Drew Papers on Profiles in Science. Three lesson plans are designed for middle and high school levels:Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/education/charlesdrew/lessonplan7-8.html"&gt;Charles R.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is pleased to announce its participation in the inaugural year of the &lt;a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/ndsr/"&gt;National Digital Stewardship Residency (NDSR)&lt;/a&gt;, a ground-breaking new program created by the Library of Congress (LC) in partnership with the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program enables 10 recent MasterÃ¢ÂÂs program graduates in relevant fields to complete a paid nine-month residency at various institutions in the Washington, DC area. Beginning in September 2013, accepted residents will attend an intensive two-week digital stewardship workshop at the Library of Congress. Thereafter, residents will move to a host institution to work on significant digital stewardship projects. These projects will allow them to acquire hands-on knowledge and skills involving the collection, selection, management, long-term preservation, and accessibility of digital assets. The &lt;a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/ndsr/hosts.html"&gt;entire list of projects&lt;/a&gt; is available on the NDSR Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM will host a resident to &lt;a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/ndsr/documents/NLM.pdf"&gt;develop a thematic Web archive collection&lt;/a&gt;.ÃÂ  The resident will create a collection of Web content on a specific theme or topic, such as medicine and art or the eÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂpatient movement. This project builds on a &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/nlm_web_content_collection.html"&gt;pilot Web archive collection&lt;/a&gt; completed by NLM last year and &lt;a href="http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2012/10/developing-a-health-and-medicine-blogs-collection-at-the-u-s-national-library-of-medicine/"&gt;featured in LCÃ¢ÂÂs The Signal in October 2012&lt;/a&gt;. The final Web archive collection will become part of the permanent collection of NLM, the worldÃ¢ÂÂs largest biomedical library.ÃÂ  The resident will be embedded in NLMÃ¢ÂÂs History of Medicine Division under the mentorship of Christie Moffatt, Manager, Digital Manuscripts Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to NLM, the inaugural NDSR host institutions include Association of Research Libraries, Dumbarton Oaks, Folger Shakespeare Library, Library of Congress, National Security Archive, PBS, Smithsonian Institution Archives, World Bank, and University of Maryland Libraries and Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LC and IMLS are accepting applications for the NDSR until April 5, 2013.ÃÂ  Applicants can &lt;a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/337969700"&gt;apply online&lt;/a&gt; to be a part of NDSRÃ¢ÂÂs inaugural class.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Elizabeth Blackwell (1700-1758) was the daughter of a successful Scottish merchant and one of the first women to establish herself as a botanical illustrator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Now available from the National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, is a Turning the Pages virtual version of Blackwell&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;A Curious Herbal&lt;/em&gt;, a book published in London in parts between 1737 and 1739. Today, this book is widely recognized by scholars and the public alike for itsÂ colorful and detailed illustrations of hundreds of medicinal plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Discover selections from &lt;em&gt;A Curious Herbal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/v2/books/#!/elizabeth-blackwells-a-curious-herbal/"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;, via &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/turning-the-pages-ttp/id423830194?mt=8" title="External link: please review our privacy policy."&gt;iPad App&lt;/a&gt;, and in kiosks &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/visitor.html"&gt;onsite at the NLM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Based on the NLM&amp;#39;s copy of &lt;em&gt;A Curious Herbal&lt;/em&gt;, which is part of the Library&amp;#39;s large and important collection of rare herbals and other books on plants and natural history, this Turning the Pages project includes 38 curated images from the over 500 plates in the book. Here readers will learn about Blackwell&amp;#39;s medicinal uses for plants, such as the white lily which she thought to be &amp;#34;good for all pains of the joints and contracted nerves,&amp;#34; and the grape vine which &amp;#34;strengthens the stomach, helps digestion, comforts ye bowels, and is a great preservative against the plague.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Blackwell originally conceived of &lt;em&gt;A Curious Herbal&lt;/em&gt; to describe and illustrate medicinal plants from the New World because her husband, Alexander, had been sent to debtors&amp;#39; prison in London, and they had an urgent need to raise funds. Â Blackwell selected and studied plant specimens at the Chelsea Physick Garden and drew the plants, while her husband wrote much of the text using his medical training.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Launched at the NLM in 2001, Turning the Pages is part of an ongoing collaboration between research engineers at the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications and curators and historians at the NLM&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division, to help make the NLM&amp;#39;s rare and unique history of medicine collections widely available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;The NLM holds one of the world&amp;#39;s largest collections of early books relating to medicine and natural history dating before the year 1800.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr.ÃÂ C. Everett Koop died on February 25, 2013, peacefully at his home in Hanover, New Hampshire. He was 96.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right:15px; margin-bottom:15px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/ResourceMetadata/QQBBRD"&gt;&lt;img alt="C.

Everett Koop&lt;/a&gt; in his office in the Hubert&lt;br /&gt;H. Humphrey Building in Washington, DC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reproduced with permission of Jon Gilbert Fox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a 35-year career as an internationally acclaimed pediatric surgeon, during the 1980s Dr. C. Everett Koop turned a federal office with a minimal budget and staff, the office of the U.S. Surgeon General, into the most authoritative platform from which to educate the nation on matters of health promotion, disease prevention, and emerging health threats, including smoking, domestic violence, disability rights, and, most urgently, AIDS.ÃÂ  Koop helped the nation face this most fearsome emerging infectious disease. On this and other issues he often surprised supporters and critics alike.ÃÂ  Ã¢ÂÂI had the privilege of working with Dr. Koop, and seeing firsthand his commitment to public health, when as Surgeon General he served on the National Library of Medicine Board of Regents,Ã¢ÂÂ said NLM Director Dr. Donald A.B. Lindberg. Ã¢ÂÂIt is especially fitting that his papers are part of the LibraryÃ¢ÂÂs online collection, Profiles in Science, given that he was such a strong advocate of health information for the public and the use of the Internet for disseminating it.Ã¢ÂÂ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through NLMÃ¢ÂÂs &lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/QQ"&gt;Profiles in Science&lt;/a&gt; Web site, which is dedicated to the lives and works of 20th-century leaders in science, medicine, and public health, visitors may view a selection of the C. Everett Koop Papers, including correspondence, speeches, lecture notes, published articles and editorials, photographs, and audiovisual recordings illustrating Dr. KoopÃ¢ÂÂs tenure as U.S. Surgeon General, from 1981 to 1989.ÃÂ  Visitors to the site can view, for example, a transcript of Dr. KoopÃ¢ÂÂs press conference announcing the release of &lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/QQBBMW"&gt;his seminal report on AIDS in October 1986&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/QQ/p-nid/86/p-visuals/true"&gt;photographs from his career as a pediatric surgeon&lt;/a&gt;. Profiles in Science also places Dr. KoopÃ¢ÂÂs accomplishments as Surgeon General in the context of the medical advances, political debates, and cultural developments of the 1980s.ÃÂ  As a special feature of this site, Dr. Koop provided &lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/browse/ResourceResult/TYPE/Memoirs/CID/QQ/YEAR/2003/MONTH/NOTEXT/sort/chron"&gt;introductions to many of his speeches&lt;/a&gt; in which he describes their context, setting, and impact.ÃÂ  &lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/NN/"&gt;The Reports of the Surgeon General&lt;/a&gt;, including those authored by Dr. Koop, are also available online through the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals interested in conducting research in the C. Everett Koop Papers are invited to consult &lt;a href="http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/koop"&gt;the finding aid to the collection&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href="mailto:custserv@nlm.nih.gov"&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; the National Library of Medicine.ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A statement on the passing of Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop by Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., Director, National Institutes of Health, can be found on: &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/about/director/02262013_statement_koop.htm"&gt;http://www.nih.gov/about/director/02262013_statement_koop.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Located in Bethesda, Maryland, the National Library of Medicine, a component of the National Institutes of Health, is the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ã¢ÂÂ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1, March 4, 2013, Features Communications Expert Dr. Gary Kreps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, is launching a five-part spring lecture series to highlight innovative approaches and best practices in evaluating health communication. As NLM and NIH diversify their use of mass communication channels to dispatch health information, a fresh consideration of evaluation&amp;#39;s cutting edge is timely and important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 1 of the series will take place &lt;strong&gt;Monday, March 4, 2013 from 3:30 to 5:00 PM&lt;/strong&gt; in the Lister Hill Auditorium, Building 38A, first floor. Dr. Gary Kreps will speak on &amp;#34;Evaluating Health Communication Programs to Enhance Health Care and Health Promotion.&amp;#34; &lt;strong&gt;The event will be videocast live and also archived at videocast.nih.gov&lt;/strong&gt;. Sign language interpreters will be provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dr. Gary Kreps" src="/news/gary_kreps.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;Â &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Gary Kreps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gary L. Kreps, PhD, is University Distinguished Professor, Chair, Department of Communication and Director of the Center for Health and Risk Communication, George Mason University. Dr. Kreps&amp;#39; areas of expertise include health communication and behavioral change, health promotion, and risk communication. Prior to his appointment at George Mason, Dr. Kreps was the founding chief of the Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch at the National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kreps will be the first speaker and serve as the discussant for the series&amp;#39; remaining talks. His presence will add continuity and facilitate a progression of learning during the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are more and increasingly diverse ways for health information to reach the public. The interest among Americans to receive health information also remains high compared to most other topics. To maximize the impact of health information on the nation&amp;#39;s well-being and empower consumers, communicators need to know whether their messages are reaching the right audience, whether the information is understood, and whether the materials make a difference in decision-making and health outcomes. As a result, evaluation is an integral and crucial part of health communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIH employees are encouraged to attend this series, as are members of the public and employees of other governmental agencies, along with faculty and students from area universities. The lectures will feature discussion and participation by audience members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPCOMING EVENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lecture 2: Wednesday, March 27, 3:30-6:00 PM, Lister Hill Auditorium, Building 38A, First Floor, National Library of Medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nancy Harrington, PhD, Professor, Associate Dean for Research, Department of Communication, College of Communication and Information, University of Kentucky.

Cohen, MD (1919-2013)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheldon Cohen, MD, a longtime friend and supporter of the historical collections at the National Library of Medicine, died peacefully at his home in Chevy Chase, Maryland on March 26, 2013. He was 94.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cohen was acutely aware of the central role of history in understanding his own clinical research into allergy and asthma.ÃÂ His own book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/news/events/meetings/Pages/classicsAllergy.aspx"&gt;Excerpts from Classics in Allergy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which only recently appeared in its third edition as a free e-book, was largely researched in the NLM History of Medicine Division (HMD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cohen was a generous donor to the History of Medicine Division, contributing many books and photographs to the collection, often in the memory of his colleagues.ÃÂ Dr. Cohen also commissioned for the library bronze busts of three of his personal heroes: Maimonides, Pasteur, and Jenner, from sculptor Karen Leigh, and a set of 20 bronze medals commemorating historically eminent physicians and medical scientists from sculptor Abram Belskie.ÃÂ The busts and medals are on permanent display in the HMD Reading Room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the late 1990s, Dr. Cohen worked closely with the NLM to develop a major exhibition that explored the history of asthma, which was curated by historians Robert Aronowitz, MD, and Carla C. Keirns, MD, PhD, MSc. Breath of Life opened March 22, 1999 and ran through March 28, 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cohen strongly championed and was instrumental in shaping Ã¢ÂÂVoices from the PastÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂVoices from the Present,Ã¢ÂÂ two sections of the NLMÃ¢ÂÂs Breath of Life exhibition, featuring biographies of notable individuals who reportedly had asthma.ÃÂ He also was a positive influence in the National Library of MedicineÃ¢ÂÂs partnering with the National Institute of Environmental Diseases, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to provide funding for the exhibition and to help shape the public health messages for the gallery on contemporary issues associated with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the support of the Friends of the National Library of Medicine, Dr. Cohen secured funding from the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology for the publication of an exhibition catalogue, and identified the essay author, science writer Charles Marwick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: center; margin-bottom:10px"&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bronze busts of Jenner, Maimonides, and Pasteur" src="/news/cohen_busts.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bronze busts of (l. to r.) Edward Jenner, Moses Maimonides, and Louis Pasteur, &lt;br /&gt;by sculptor Karen Leigh. Dr. Cohen commissioned these busts, which are on permanent display &lt;br /&gt;in the History of Medicine Reading Room of the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library, is a component of the US National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that more than 90 percent of patients who stopped taking statins because of an adverse reaction could tolerate the medication when tried again. The study is published in the April 2, 2013 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM grantee &lt;a href="http://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/Details/1657?index=1&amp;#38;lastName=Turchin"&gt;Alexander Turchin&lt;/a&gt; MD, MS, of Brigham and Women&amp;#39;s Hospital notes that statins are commonly stopped even though their benefits are well documented. He and colleagues wanted to better understand why statins are discontinued and whether adverse reactions play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They conducted a retrospective study, analyzing clinical data in an electronic medical record (EMR) system. Researchers examined structured data as well as the narrative electronic notes of health providers. Those notes frequently are the only place in an EMR where adverse reactions to medications are documented. Using the NLM grant, researchers developed natural language processing software and scoured more than 5 million notes, on more than 107,000 patients, recorded over nearly a decade. The software generated data on a scale that could not have been done manually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say the next step would be to conduct a clinical trial to determine if outcomes are improved when statins are tried again after an adverse event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health, conducts and funds research in biomedical informatics-applying computers and communications technology to the field of health. This research was supported by NLM&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/index.html"&gt;Division of Extramural Programs&lt;/a&gt; grant RC1-LM010460. This was an NIH Challenge Grant, supported by NLM with funds from the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/awardsarra.html"&gt;American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://brighamandwomens.org/about_bwh/publicaffairs/news/pressreleases/PressRelease.aspx?sub=0&amp;#38;PageID=1425"&gt;Brigham and Women&amp;#39;s Hospital News Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Includes More than 3.7 Million Bibliographic Items Spanning Five Centuries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, announces that Extensible Markup Language (XML) data from the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/indexcat/ichome.html"&gt;IndexCatÃ¢ÂÂ¢ database&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/indexcat/indexcatxml.html"&gt;now available for free download&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Released with a Document Type Definition (DTD) that allows researchers to validate the data, this new XML release includes the digitized content of more than 3.7 million bibliographic items from the printed, 61-volume &lt;em&gt;Index-Catalogue of the Library of the Surgeon-General&amp;#39;s Office&lt;/em&gt;, originally published from 1880 to 1961. The XML describes items spanning five centuries, including millions of journal and newspaper articles, obituaries, and letters, hundreds of thousands of monographs and dissertations, and thousands of portraits. Together, these items cover a wide range of subjects such as the basic sciences, scientific research, civilian and military medicine, public health, and hospital administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM release of the Index-Catalogue in XML format opens this key resource in the history of medicine and science to new uses and users. It is one of the monuments of &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2670211/pdf/mlab-97-02-108.pdf"&gt;the Library&amp;#39;s longstanding, systematic indexing of the medical literature&lt;/a&gt;, an effort which William Henry Welch (1850-1934), the great pathologist and bibliophile, considered to be &amp;#34;America&amp;#39;s greatest contribution to medical knowledge.&amp;#34; This indexing, begun by John Shaw Billings in the nineteenth century at the Library of the Surgeon-General&amp;#39;s Office, United States Army (known today as the NLM), eventually created two distinct products: the &lt;em&gt;Index-Catalogue of the Library of the Surgeon-General&amp;#39;s Office&lt;/em&gt;, United States Army and the &lt;em&gt;Index Medicus&lt;/em&gt;, forerunner of MEDLINEÃÂ®, and now the largest component of &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;.ÃÂ®&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Released alongside the IndexCatalogue XML are an &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/indexcat/indexcatxml.html#eTKeVK2"&gt;integrated XML file and associated DTD&lt;/a&gt; for two collections developed from the electronic database of &lt;em&gt;A Catalogue of Incipits of Mediaeval Scientific Writings&lt;/em&gt; in Latin (rev.), by Lynn Thorndike and Pearl Kibre (eTK) and the updated and expanded version of &lt;em&gt;Scientific and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Medical Writings in Old and Middle English: An Electronic Reference&lt;/em&gt; (eVK2) edited by Linda Ehrsam Voigts and Patricia Deery Kurtz. Also available via the online IndexCat, these resources encompass over 42,000 records of incipits, or the beginning words of a medieval manuscript or early printed book, covering various medical and scientific writings on topics as diverse as astronomy, astrology, geometry, agriculture, household skills, book production, occult science, natural science, and mathematics, as these disciplines and others were largely intermingled in the medieval period of European history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM release of these resources in XML format joins many other freely downloadable resources, including the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/licensee/medpmmenu.html"&gt;XML for MEDLINEÃÂ®/PubMedÃÂ® data&lt;/a&gt;, which includes over 22 million references to biomedical and life sciences journal articles back to 1946, and, for some journals, much earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The releaseÃÂ also coincides with the NLM&amp;#39;s participation in &lt;a href="http://mith.umd.edu/sharedhorizons/"&gt;&amp;#34;Shared Horizons: Data, Biomedicine, and the Digital Humanities,&amp;#34;&lt;/a&gt; an interdisciplinary symposium exploring the intersection of digital humanities and biomedicine.ÃÂ  To be held April 10-12, 2013 in partnership with the &lt;a href="http://www.neh.gov/odh/"&gt;National Endowment for the Humanities&amp;#39; Office of Digital Humanities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://mith.umd.edu/"&gt;Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities at the University of Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/"&gt;Research Councils UK&lt;/a&gt;, Shared Horizons will create opportunities for disciplinary cross-fertilization through a mix of formal and informal presentations combined with breakout sessions designed to promote a rich exchange of ideas about how large-scale quantitative methods can lead to new understandings of human culture. Bringing together researchers from the digital humanities and bioinformatics communities, the symposium will explore ways in which these two communities might fruitfully collaborate on projects that bridge the humanities and medicine around the topics of sequence alignment and network analysis, two modes of analysis that intersect with &amp;#34;big data.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Shared Horizons sessions will be live-streamed with a monitored back channel for the public to post/tweet comments. Recordings of all talks will also be posted to the &lt;a href="http://mith.umd.edu/sharedhorizons/"&gt;Shared Horizons website&lt;/a&gt;, with the ability to comment pre- and post-event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inquiries about the new XML datasets associated with the IndexCatalogue and eTKeVK2 may be directed to &lt;a href="http://apps2.nlm.nih.gov/mainweb/siebel/nlm/index.cfm"&gt;NLM Customer Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations Ensure Long-Term Online Accessibility to Scholarly Journals Even After Title and Publisher Changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a component of the National Institutes of Health, has a deep interest in the publishing models used by scientific journals, from the viewpoints of practical and efficient use of titles that are indexed for MEDLINE, and the clear and accurate preservation of the scientific literature for use by future generations. ÃÂ As such, it has been a partner in the development of a Recommended Practice that will provide guidance on the presentation and identification of electronic journals, an undertaking of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 27, 2013, NISO announced the publication of a new Recommended Practice: &lt;em&gt;PIE-J: Presentation &amp;#38; Identification of E-Journals&lt;/em&gt; (NISO RP-16-2013). This Recommended Practice was developed to provide guidance on the presentation of e-journalsÃ¢ÂÂparticularly in the areas of title presentation, accurate use of ISSN, and citation practicesÃ¢ÂÂto publishers and platform providers, as well as to solve some long-standing concerns of serials, collections, and electronic resources librarians. In addition to the recommendations, the document includes extensive examples of good practices using screenshots from various publishers&amp;#39; online journals platforms; a discussion of helpful resources for obtaining title history and ISSN information; an overview of the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) and key points for using it correctly; an explanation of the Digital Object Identifier (DOIÃÂ®), the registration agency CrossRef, and tips on using DOIs for journal title management; and a review of related standards and recommended practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Citations form the basis for much scholarly research. Unless journal Web sites accurately and uniformly list all the titles under which content was published, user access to desired content is considerably diminished,&amp;#34; explains Cindy Hepfer, Continuing E-Resource Management and Cataloging Librarian at the State University of New York at Buffalo and Co-chair of the NISO PIE-J Working Group. &amp;#34;For example, many e-journal publishers and aggregators now place digitized content originally published under an earlier title on the Web site for the current title, using the current ISSN, thus seriously impeding the researcher&amp;#39;s ability to find or identify the content being sought. The PIE-J project was initiated to address these issues.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The publishers and providers of e-journals take great pride in the diverse designs of their Web sites,&amp;#34; states Bob Boissy, Manager, Account Development &amp;#38; Strategic Alliances at Springer and Co-chair of the NISO PIE-J Working Group. &amp;#34;Yet how these Web sites present, identify, and link together the publications that they display can make the end users&amp;#39; task of discovering articles and accessing them easy, frustrating, or completely fruitless. Application of the PIE-J recommended practice guidelines will result in improved discovery and access that will benefit researchers, authors, librarians, online providers, and publishers.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The PIE-J Recommended Practice provides a clear and succinct list of guidelines that publishers can easily implement to facilitate long-term access to their e-journal content,&amp;#34; declares Todd Carpenter, NISO Executive Director. &amp;#34;This constructive advice will aid publishers with the presentation of born-digital content as well as supporting the continued digitization of content from journals originally published only in print.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PIE-J Recommended Practice and a brochure summarizing the recommendations are available from the NISO PIE-J workroom Web site at: &lt;a href="http://www.niso.org/workrooms/piej/"&gt;www.niso.org/workrooms/piej/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;ÃÂ # # #&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;On April 25, 2003, the National Library of Medicine launched Genetics Home Reference (GHR), a free online resource about human genetics created for patients, families, and the general public (&lt;a href="http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt;). The Web site provides a bridge between the public&amp;#39;s questions about human genetics and the rich technical data that has emerged from the Human Genome Project (observing the 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary of its completion on April 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;) and other genomic research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GHR provides consumer-friendly summaries of genetic conditions and their associated genes, gene families, and chromosomes. The site also features a primer called &amp;#34;Help Me Understand Genetics,&amp;#34; an illustrated introduction to fundamental topics in human genetics including mutations, inheritance, genetic testing, gene therapy, and genomic research. Additionally, GHR offers helpful background information, including a glossary of genetic and medical terms and links to numerous other quality resources. A &amp;#34;Spotlight&amp;#34; feature on the GHR home page highlights important observances and discoveries in the field of human genetics and draws attention to useful learning tools and clinical resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it was launched a decade ago, Genetics Home Reference featured 19 condition summaries and 16 gene descriptions. Today, GHR offers easy-to-read summaries of about 850 genetic conditions, more than 1,060 genes, more than 80 gene families, all of the human chromosomes, and mitochondrial DNA. New summaries are added regularly. GHR currently receives about 43,000 visitors per day and 39 million hits per month, suggesting that it continues to be an important and useful health resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;a href="http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Genetics Home Reference Banner" src="/news/ghr_banner.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The U.S. National Library of Medicine, the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library, is a component of the National Institutes of Health. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;###&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;The National Library of Medicine has launched an &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/avoyagetohealth/"&gt;online adaptation&lt;/a&gt; of the traveling banner exhibition, &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/avoyagetohealth/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Voyage to Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an exploration of how the revival of Native Hawaiian sea voyaging traditions helped heal the soul of the community. The launch of the Web site celebrates the 19-year anniversary of the May 9, 1994 return of Kanaloa KahoÃ¢ÂÂolawe island to the Hawaiian people by the United States Navy.ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;This online project begins with the migration of voyagers from the South Pacific who settled on the Hawaiian island of Kanaloa KahoÃ¢ÂÂolawe and details the loss of sovereignty and suppression of culture Native Hawaiians experienced by the US annexation of HawaiÃ¢ÂÂi.ÃÂ It highlights the contemporary movement to reclaim and protect Kanaloa KahoÃ¢ÂÂolawe, and the restoration of traditional sea voyaging, which have served as unexpected catalysts of a Native Hawaiian cultural renaissance-a reconnection to ancient sources of pride and wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;The Web site is augmented by &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/avoyagetohealth/education/index.html"&gt;education resources&lt;/a&gt; that explore the exhibition content: two lesson plans for grades 4-8; a six-class higher education module developed by noted Native Hawaiian scholar Davianna PÃÂÃÂmaikaÃ¢ÂÂi McGregor, PhD; two online activities; and a collection of other online resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Voyage to Health&lt;/em&gt; was curated by Davianna PÃÂÃÂmaikaÃ¢ÂÂi McGregor, PhD (University of HawaiÃ¢ÂÂi), Hardy Spoehr (Papa Ola Lokahi), and Maile Taualii, PhD, MPH (Papa Ola Lokahi), in cooperation with NLM Exhibition Program curator Manon Parry, PhD. The traveling banner exhibition &lt;em&gt;A Voyage to Health&lt;/em&gt; has traveled to 17 locations in the continental United States and nine locations around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Please visit the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/about/exhibition/avoyagetohealth-bookinfo.html"&gt;traveling exhibition services Web site&lt;/a&gt; for more information about &lt;em&gt;A Voyage to Health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="items"&gt;&lt;div class="columnA" style="width:45%;"&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hokulea" height="337" src="/news/voyage1.jpg" width="428" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HÃÂÃÂkÃÂÃÂ«leÃ¢ÂÂa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;The ancient arts of navigation and voyaging that brought the people of HawaiÃ¢ÂÂi to their island homes are being revived. As part of a wider movement to reintroduce traditional ways, Native Hawaiians are mastering the knowledge and skills of their elders. By restoring their heritage, this new generation of voyagers seeks to heal the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;Photographed by Monte Costa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtesy of Monte Costa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnB" style="width:50%;"&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="Hokulea a returning from its first voyage to Tahiti" src="/news/voyage2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HÃÂÃÂkÃÂÃÂ«leÃ¢ÂÂa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; returning from its first voyage to Tahiti&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;Photographed by Monte Costa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;CourtesyÃÂ of Monte Costa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="items"&gt;&lt;div class="columnA" style="width:45%;"&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Nainoa Thompson and Mau Piailug" src="/news/voyage3.jpg" /&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nainoa Thompson and Mau Piailug&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;In 1976, in an effort to reintroduce the lost art of Native Hawaiian voyaging, Nainoa Thompson began his search for a master navigator to learn from. He eventually persuaded Mau Piailug of Satawal, Federated States of Micronesia, to break with custom and teach an outsider the tradition of wayfinding without instrumentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;Photographed by Monte Costa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtesy of Monte Costa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnB" style="width:50%;"&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="Star compass illustration" src="/news/voyage4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Star compass illustration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;The Hawaiian Star Compass was developed by C.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is pleased to be included in a new exhibition which opened May 15 and runs through August 18, 2013 at The Cloisters museum and gardens, the branch of The &lt;a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/"&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt; for medieval art and architecture in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Search for the Unicorn: An Exhibition in Honor of The Cloisters&amp;#39; 75th Anniversary&lt;/em&gt; places the institution&amp;#39;s famous Unicorn Tapestries within the larger context of medieval and Renaissance art, revealing the mythical animal&amp;#39;s persistent inspirational role in artistic imagination over the centuries and in the emerging history of natural science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. in time for the opening of The Cloisters in 1938, the Unicorn Tapestries are its best-known masterpieces; yet, 75 years later, their history and meaning remain elusive. They have been seen both as complicated metaphors for Christ and as emblems of matrimony, and they are beloved as quaint indications of medieval notions about the natural world. This exhibition of some 40 works of art drawn from the collections of the Metropolitan,Â sister institutions, and private collections invites audiences to see the Unicorn Tapestries anew, as the finest expression of a subject widely treated across cultures, and in both European art and science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featured in &lt;em&gt;Search for the Unicorn&lt;/em&gt; are two items from the NLM&amp;#39;s historical collections, Pierre Pomet&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Histoire gÃ©nÃ©rale des drogues&lt;/em&gt; (1694) and al-Qazwini&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Wonders of Creation&lt;/em&gt; (ca. 1700).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wonders of Creation&lt;/em&gt; was compiled originally in the middle 1200s and is considered one of the most important natural history texts of the medieval Islamic world. It is featured in NLM&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/books.htm"&gt;Turning the Pages program&lt;/a&gt;. Pomet&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Histoire gÃ©nÃ©rale des drogues&lt;/em&gt; is primarily a historical examination and description of drugs and medicines, and examines unicorns because of the magical healing properties attributed to their horns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about The Cloisters and its exhibition, &lt;em&gt;Search for the Unicorn&lt;/em&gt;, visit: &lt;a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/en/exhibitions/listings/2013/search-for-the-unicorn"&gt;http://www.metmuseum.org/en/exhibitions/listings/2013/search-for-the-unicorn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The National Library of Medicine (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;), a component of the National Institutes of Health, is the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library.

    <body>&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;On May 16, 2013, the Archivists and Librarians in the History of the Health Sciences (ALHHS) awarded NLM&amp;#39;s historian Michael Sappol, PhD, with the 2013 ALHHS best monograph award, and NLM&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division Chief, Jeffrey S. Reznick, PhD, with the 2013 ALHHS best article award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Dr. Sappol received his honor for his editorship of the book &lt;em&gt;Hidden Treasure: The National Library of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. Published in 2012, &lt;em&gt;Hidden Treasure&lt;/em&gt; is a richly-illustrated volume that celebrates the collections of the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library on the occasion of its 175th anniversary, which occurred in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hidden Treasure&lt;/em&gt; has received praise from the &lt;a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1309148"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/17/science/hidden-treasure-at-the-national-library-of-medicine.html?_r=3&amp;#38;ref=science&amp;#38;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/04/library-of-medicine-gallery/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/graphic-and-grotesque"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eye Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and numerous other media outlets. Scholars have also praised the book: &amp;#34;Opening this volume is like lifting up the lid of a treasure chest,&amp;#34; observed John Harley Warner, chair of History of Medicine at the Yale University School of Medicine. &amp;#34;Brilliantly conceived and beautifully produced, this is an amazing exploration of the visual and material cultures of health, medicine, and the body in their widest and most imaginative reaches.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hidden Treasure&lt;/em&gt; is available free from NLM&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://resource.nlm.nih.gov/101569502"&gt;Digital Collections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Dr. Reznick received the 2013 ALHHS best article award for &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3381362/"&gt;&amp;#34;Remains of War: Walt Whitman, Civil War Soldiers, and the Legacy of Medical Collections,&amp;#34;&lt;/a&gt; which he co-authored with Lenore Barbian, PhD, of Edinboro University and Paul Sledzik, former curator of Anatomical Collections at the National Museum of Health and Medicine. The article appeared in the January 2012 issue of &lt;em&gt;Museum History Journal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&amp;#34;Remains of War&amp;#34; reveals the discovery of the mortal remains of four American Civil War soldiers among the thousands preserved in the anatomical collections of the National Museum of Health and Medicine, which traces its origins to 1862 and the creation of the U.S. Army Medical Museum. These men were among hundreds cared for by author Walt Whitman during his time as a volunteer in the Civil War-era hospitals of Washington, DC. Uniting the remains of these four men with Whitman&amp;#39;s words that describe his experiences, &amp;#34;Remains of War&amp;#34; yields a new interpretation of medical collections that bears witness to deeply individual histories during a time of unprecedented conflict in American history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;ALHHS also honored the &lt;a href="http://www.medicalheritage.org/"&gt;Medical Heritage Library&lt;/a&gt; (MHL) with its 2013 award for best online resource. Initiated in 2009 with funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation via the nonprofit organization Open Knowledge Commons, the MHL is a digital curation collaborative among some of the world&amp;#39;s leading medical librariesÃ¢ÂÂincluding the NLMÃ¢ÂÂto promote free and open access to quality historical resources in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;The ALHHS is an association established exclusively for educational purposes to serve the professional interests of librarians, archivists, and other specialists actively engaged in the librarianship of the history of the health sciences, by promoting the exchange of information and by improving standards of service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;ALHHS presents its annual publication awardsÃ¢ÂÂfor best article, monograph, and online resourceÃ¢ÂÂto members of the association who are authors of academic, trade, or privately published works related to the history of the health care sciences, or works on the bibliography, librarianship, and/or curatorship of historical collections in the health care sciences. Works published within three years prior to the year of the award are eligible for the honor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hidden Treasure: The National Library of Medicine." src="/news/hidden_treasures.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Treasure: The National Library of Medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited by Michael Sappol, and published in 2012 by Blast Books&lt;br /&gt;in cooperation with the National Library of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="items"&gt;&lt;div class="columnA" style="width:45%;"&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;img alt="Walt Whitman" src="/news/walt_whitman.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walt Whitman circa 1863, from a portrait by Gardner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtesy of the Library of Congress from the Feinberg-Whitman Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/em&gt;During the American Civil War, Whitman consoled soldiers by writing down their stories, writing letters for them, giving them small gifts, holding them, and comforting them through conversation. His purpose, he wrote, was to &amp;#34;[give] some trifle for a novelty or changeÃ¢ÂÂanything, however trivial, to break the monotony of those hospital hours.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnB" style="width:50%;"&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="The mortal remains of Private Oscar Cunningham, 82nd Ohio Infantry." height="294" src="/news/remains.jpg" width="345" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mortal remains of Private Oscar Cunningham, 82nd Ohio Infantry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photograph courtesy of the National Museum of Health and Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;On May 2, 1863, during the battle of Chancellorsville, Cunningham received a gunshot wound to his right thigh that resulted in a compound fracture of the femur. Whitman would later write about Cunningham, shortly before his death: &amp;#34;...It is a tragedy that would touch the most hardened heart to see this exemplar of young manhood suffering...&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This Spanish-language Web site is designed to provide health information resources to the Latino community in an easy-to-use format, utilizing culturally appropriate and relevant language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM will be promoting the &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA Web site through a multi-platform media outreach effort that includes two new radio public service announcements that will air on Spanish media outlets nationwide. In addition, Ms. Fedora Braverman, a librarian with the NLM Public Services Division, will take part in a June 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; broadcast of &amp;#34;&lt;em&gt;Bienvenidos a AmÃ©rica&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;#34; discussing &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA and other Spanish-language consumer resources from NLM. &lt;em&gt;Bienvenidos a A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;mÃ©rica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; (BAA) &lt;/em&gt;is a weekly call-in radio show focused on providing Spanish preferred Latinos with information and resources specific to immigration issues. Since this program&amp;#39;s audience is a key component in determining the success of this campaign, NLM will utilize this program, which airs on 111 Spanish radio stations nationwide. In addition to being on the air, the NLM specific segment on BAA will be streamed and made available online at bienvenidosradio.com. The online resources of &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA will also be publicized and made available via NLM&amp;#39;s social media outlets. (Twitter users are invited to follow or join the conversation by using the hash tag #infoSIDA2013.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today in America, according to the CDC, approximately one in 50 Latinos will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetime. The rate of new HIV infections among Latino men is almost three times that of white men (39.9 vs. 15.9 per 100,000), and the rate among Latinas is more than four times that of white women (11.8 vs. 2.6 per 100,000). In 2009, Hispanics/Latinos represented 16% of the U.S. population but accounted for 20% of new HIV infections. Statistics like these and a need to reach vulnerable populations were a driving force in NLM&amp;#39;s recognizing the need to speak directly to Latinos on the issue of HIV/AIDS, in a culturally relevant manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rich and varied content of &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA includes:Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guidelines&lt;/strong&gt; of federally-approved HIV treatment and prevention for HIV infection and AIDS-related illnesses, including the prevention of HIV transmission from occupational exposure, mother-to-child transmission, and prevention and treatment of HIV-related opportunistic infections; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical trials information&lt;/strong&gt; on federally and privately funded studies evaluating experimental drugs and other therapies for adults and children at all stages of HIV infection; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drugs&lt;/strong&gt; information, including records for FDA-approved and investigational HIV/AIDS-related drugs. This information is presented in versions for the patient and the health professional.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIV/AIDS health topics&lt;/strong&gt;, a comprehensive collection of links to government resources for patients and consumers;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education materials&lt;/strong&gt; about HIV/AIDS, for both patients and health care providers; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile resources&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and tools&lt;/strong&gt; for iPhone, iPad and Android devices, allowing access anytime, anywhere; and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The AIDS&lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt; HIV/AIDS Glossary app&lt;/strong&gt;, which provides access to the same terms found in the &lt;a href="http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/glossary"&gt;AIDS&lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt; Glossary of HIV/AIDS-Related Terms&lt;/a&gt;. The app includes English and Spanish-language definitions of more than 700 terms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more information, visit &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.infosida.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;infosida.nih.gov&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow NLM on Twitter &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nlm_news"&gt;&lt;em&gt;@NLM_News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and sign up for e-mail updates on infoSIDA at: &lt;a href="http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/e-news/"&gt;http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/e-news/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;###Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnB" style="width:50%;"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;El sitio ofrece un amplio abanico de informaciÃ³n confiable en espaÃ±ol sobre el VIH/SIDA&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;La Biblioteca Nacional de Medicina (NLM), la biblioteca mÃ©dica mÃ¡s grande del mundo y un pilar de los Institutos Nacionales de Salud (NIH), iniciÃ³ un esfuerzo de acercamiento con la comunidad latina para su sitio Web federal sobre SIDA, &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA (&lt;a href="http://www.infosida.nih.gov/"&gt;infosida.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA es un recurso gratuito en lÃ­nea en espaÃ±ol con informaciÃ³n sobre el tratamiento, prevenciÃ³n y resultados de investigaciones del VIH/SIDA. Es un servicio del Departamento de Salud y Servicios Humanos (HHS) de Estados Unidos e incluye informaciÃ³n acreditada de las siguientes agencias del HHS: los Institutos Nacionales de Salud, incluyendo la NLM; la AdministraciÃ³n de Recursos y Servicios de Salud (HRSA); y los Centros para el Control y PrevenciÃ³n de Enfermedades (CDC). El sitio Web en espaÃ±ol estÃ¡ diseÃ±ado para ofrecer recursos de informaciÃ³n sobre salud para la comunidad latina en un formato sencillo, utilizando un lenguaje culturalmente apropiado y relevante.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La NLM promoverÃ¡ el sitio &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA a travÃ©s de una campaÃ±a de acercamiento mediÃ¡tico en mÃºltiples plataformas, incluidos dos nuevos anuncios radiales de servicio pÃºblico que serÃ¡n transmitidos en medios informativos en espaÃ±ol en todo el paÃ­s. Adicionalmente, Fedora Braverman, una bibliotecaria con la DivisiÃ³n de Servicios PÃºblicos de la NLM, participarÃ¡ el 1 de junio en una transmisiÃ³n de &lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;Bienvenidos a AmÃ©rica&amp;#34;&lt;/em&gt; discutiendo &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA y otros recursos en espaÃ±ol de la NLM para los consumidores. &lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;Bienvenidos a AmÃ©rica&amp;#34;&lt;/em&gt;Â  (BAA) es un programa radial semanal de llamadas en vivo que ofrece a los hispanoparlantes Â informaciÃ³n y recursos especÃ­ficos sobre temas de inmigraciÃ³n. La audiencia del programa es un componente clave para determinar el Ã©xito de esta campaÃ±a, por lo que NLM utilizarÃ¡ a BAA, que se transmite en 111 estaciones radiales en espaÃ±ol a nivel nacional. AdemÃ¡s el segmento especÃ­fico de NLM serÃ¡ transferidoÂ  y puesto a disposiciÃ³n en lÃ­nea en bienvenidosradio.com. Los recursos en lÃ­nea de &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA serÃ¡n tambiÃ©n promovidos y puestos a disposiciÃ³n del pÃºblico a travÃ©s de las plataformas de las redes sociales de la NLM. (Los usuarios de Twitter estÃ¡n invitados a seguirnos y sumarse a la conversaciÃ³n usando el &amp;#34;hash tag&amp;#34; #infoSIDA2013).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aproximadamente uno de cada 50 latinos serÃ¡ diagnosticado con VIH durante su vida, de acuerdo con la CDC. La tasa de nuevas infecciones de VIH entre los hombres latinos es casi tres veces mÃ¡s alta que la de los hombres blancos (39.9 vs. 15.9 por 100,000 habitantes), la tasa entre las mujeres latinas es mÃ¡s de cuatro veces mayor que la de las mujeres blancas (11.8 vs. 2.6 por 100,000). En 2009, los hispanos/latinos representaron el 16% de la poblaciÃ³n de Estados Unidos pero constituyeron el 20% de nuevas infecciones de VIH. Tales estadÃ­sticas y la necesidad de acercarse a las poblaciones vulnerables fueron el impulso principal para que NLM reconociera la necesidad de dirigirse directamente los latinos en el tema de VIH/SIDA, en una manera culturalmente relevante.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El enriquecedor y variado contenido de &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA incluye:Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GuÃ­as&lt;/strong&gt; para los tratamientos aprobados a nivel federal para el VIH y para la prevenciÃ³n de infecciones de VIH y enfermedades relacionadas con el SIDA, incluida la prevenciÃ³n de la transmisiÃ³n del VIH de exposiciÃ³n en el centro de trabajo, transmisiÃ³n madre-hijo, asÃ­ como prevenciÃ³n y tratamiento de infecciones oportunistas relacionadas con el VIH.Â &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;InformaciÃ³n de pruebas clÃ­nicas&lt;/strong&gt; sobre estudios financiados a nivel federal y de manera privada evaluando medicinas experimentales y otras terapias para adultos y niÃ±os en todas las etapas de la infecciÃ³n del VIH;Â &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;InformaciÃ³n de medicamentos&lt;/strong&gt;, incluyendo registros para medicamentos aprobados por la FDA e investigaciones de VIH/SIDA. Esta informaciÃ³n es presentada en una versiÃ³n para el paciente y otra para los profesionales de la salud.Â &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temas de salud VIH/SIDA&lt;/strong&gt;, una recopilaciÃ³n integral de enlaces con los recursos del gobierno para pacientes y consumidores;Â &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Materiales educativos &lt;/strong&gt;sobre el VIH/SIDA, tanto para pacientes como proveedores de salud;Â &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recursos mÃ³viles y herramientas&lt;/strong&gt; para iPhone, iPad y aparatos Android, que permiten al acceso a todas horas, en cualquier lugar; yÂ &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;La aplicaciÃ³n (app) &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA Glosario VIH/SIDA&lt;/strong&gt; que ofrece acceso a los mismos tÃ©rminos encontrados en el glosario &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is pleased to announce the 2013-2014 year of the leadership program jointly sponsored with the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries (AAHSL). The NLM/AAHSL Leadership Fellows Program is focused on preparing emerging leaders for the position of library director in academic health sciences libraries.&lt;br /&gt;Â &lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;NLM continues to be pleased with the success of this collaboration with AAHSL,&amp;#34; said NLM Director Donald A.B. Lindberg, MD. &amp;#34;Since 2002, this leadership program has been invaluable in preparing library managers who are rising stars to move into directorship positions.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AAHSL president M.J. Tooey said, &amp;#34;AAHSL was one of the early organizations to recognize the importance of identifying and preparing future leaders. Our program, in partnership with NLM, has for more than a decade been a model for best practices in association leadership development programs. We are justifiably proud of the program and of the future leaders it has nurtured.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellows will have the opportunity to develop their knowledge and skills in a variety of learning settings, including exposure to leadership in another environment. They will be paired with mentors who are academic health sciences library directors. In addition to the individual relationship with their mentors, fellows benefit from working collaboratively with other fellows and mentors. Experienced program faculty and mentors will provide content and facilitation for the cohort. The program takes advantage of flexible scheduling and an online learning community to minimize disruption to professional and personal schedules. The sponsors will provide financial support for a small cohort of fellows and will underwrite travel and meeting expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-five fellows have participated in the program in the first eleven classes. To date, 22 fellows have been appointed to director positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The program has been invaluable to me as I guide and develop a library at a new medical school,&amp;#34; said Nadine Dexter, fellow, class of 2006-2007, and director at University of Central Florida. &amp;#34;I am using many of the concepts and principles, as well as tapping into the network of colleagues. Even when the program is over, ideas and connections continue.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tania Bardyn, fellow, class of 2010-2011, and director, University of Washington, said, &amp;#34;The things taught in the program are not just about being a director, but about the means of leading, identifying the key issues we face today in health sciences libraries, and thinking of it as your ticket to change librarianship.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evelyn Morgen, mentor, class of 2011-2012, and director at University of Connecticut, stated, &amp;#34;I think both of us-my fellow and I-added to our leadership skills and to our understanding of current issues facing academic medical libraries. It was especially interesting to see all this from the perspective of multiple institutions and ranges of career development.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Program Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one-year program design is multi-faceted: three in-person leadership institutes; attendance at an Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) annual meeting; a yearlong fellow/mentor relationship; webinars and discussions on issues related to library leadership; and two weeks of site visit to the mentor&amp;#39;s home library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program is designed to:Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="unIndentedList"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduce fellows to leadership theory and practical tools for implementing change at organizational and professional levels;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduce fellows to critical issues facing academic health sciences libraries;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop meaningful professional relationships between fellows and mentors that give fellows access to career guidance and support;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expose fellows to another academic health sciences library and its institutional leadership under the guidance of their mentors;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examine career development and provide models of directors to fellows;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a cohort of leaders who will draw upon each other for support throughout their careers;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Promote diversity in the leadership of the profession; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Offer recognition to emerging leaders and enhance the competitive standing of fellows as they pursue director positions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Application&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM/AAHSL Leadership Fellows Program is currently accepting applications and nominations for the August 1, 2013, deadline for potential fellows for the 2013-2014 experience. Candidates for fellow should have a strong interest in pursuing a directorship in academic health sciences libraries, as well as significant management experience. Applications are welcomed from professionals working in academic health sciences libraries, hospital libraries, or other library-related settings. Applications from qualified minority candidates are encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directors with at least five years&amp;#39; experience as director of an academic health sciences library should indicate preliminary interest in being matched as a mentor by contacting the AAHSL Future Leadership Committee by August 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program brochure, including information on program design, schedule, and application process, is available at &lt;a href="http://www.aahsl.org/assets/documents/2013/2013-2014_nlm_aahsl_lfp.pdf"&gt;http://www.aahsl.org/assets/documents/2013/2013-2014_nlm_aahsl_lfp.pdf&lt;/a&gt;. For more information about the program, please contact Carolyn Lipscomb, Program Manager, AAHSL Future Leadership Committee, &lt;a href="mailto:carolynlipscomb@cs.com"&gt;carolynlipscomb@cs.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The National Library of Medicine, a component of the US National Institutes of Health, is the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NCBI Director Dr. David Lipman, Stanford University&amp;#39;s Dr. Atul Butte Honored&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. David J. Lipman, director of NLM&amp;#39;s National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and Dr. Atul Butte of Stanford University, an NLM grantee, are among those to be honored today at a White House ceremony for recipients of the prestigious &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/champions"&gt;Champions of Change awards&lt;/a&gt; in the &amp;#34;Open Science&amp;#34; category. They have been recognized for their outstanding work in &amp;#34;promoting and using open scientific data and publications to accelerate progress and improve our world.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Dr. Lipman and Dr. Butte are both highly deserving of this prestigious award,&amp;#34; said NLM Director Dr. Donald Lindberg. &amp;#34;Dr. Lipman has been a tremendous-and irresistible-force in making biomedical data and information publicly and easily available. At the other end of the spectrum, Dr. Butte has been a pioneer and innovator in exploiting huge quantities of electronic data and information to make discoveries and improve health care.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his 24 years as the founding director of &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;NCBI&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. David Lipman has played a major role in expanding public access to scientific data and biomedical literature.Â A strong advocate of open exchange of genomic data, he led effortsÂ  to streamline submission, curation, and international exchange of genetic sequence data with Europe and Japan, expanding &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/"&gt;GenBank&lt;/a&gt; to become the world&amp;#39;s largest public database of DNA data, with more than 250 million sequences. Under his leadership, NCBI has built upon GenBank with the development of more than 40 interlinked genomic and bibliographic databases freely available on the Web, making many innovations in data standards, data submission, and curation along the way. With the advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web, Dr. Lipman directed the creation of &lt;a href="http://www.pubmed.gov/"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;, which pioneered the efficient linking of NLM&amp;#39;s authoritative &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html"&gt;MEDLINE&lt;/a&gt; journal references and abstracts to the full-text ofÂ  articles on publishers websites.Â When broad access to the Internet enabled NLM to cease charging for MEDLINE access in 1997, PubMed became the international vehicle for free public access to now more than 22 million authoritative biomedical journal references, many with abstracts. In 2000, through innovative arrangements with publishers, Dr. Lipman introduced &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"&gt;PubMed Central (PMC)&lt;/a&gt; to provide free permanent electronic access to the full text of articles from participating journals, with rich links to related scientific data.Â PMC provided the essential infrastructure for the NIH Public Access Policy, which since 2008 has made published NIH-funded research available to the public.Â Together, information services directed by Dr. Lipman are used by more than three million people each day.Â He has also been a pioneer in making electronic data accessible to external system developers through bulk download and robust applications programming interfaces (APIs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;I am truly honored that the White House has recognized our work in providing resources such as NCBI&amp;#39;s GenBank database of all publicly available DNA sequences and PubMed Central, an online archive of peer-reviewed biomedical sciences literature,&amp;#34; said Dr. Lipman. &amp;#34;The success of these databases and NCBI&amp;#39;s many other resources is a reflection of the hard work, dedication and talent of all those working at NCBI and a testament to the vision and leadership at NLM and NIH.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Lipman received his undergraduate degree from Brown University and his MD from the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including election to the US National Academy of Sciences in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atul Butte is chief of the Division of Systems Medicine and Associate Professor of Pediatrics, Medicine and, by courtesy, Computer Science, at Stanford University and Lucile Packard Children&amp;#39;s Hospital. The Butte Laboratory at Stanford builds and uses computational tools that convert more than 400 trillion points of molecular, clinical, and epidemiological data-measured by researchers and clinicians over the past decade and now increasingly publicly available-into diagnostics, therapeutics, and new insights into disease. In addition to creating new diagnostics and drugs for diabetes and cancers and stewarding the release of National Institutes of Health (NIH) immunology data to the public, Dr. Butte is a founder of Personalis, providing clinical interpretation of whole genome sequences, Carmenta, discovering diagnostics for life-threatening conditions in pregnancy from public data, and NuMedii, using public big data to find new uses for drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He received his MD at Brown University, trained in pediatrics and pediatric endocrinology at Children&amp;#39;s Hospital Boston, then received his PhD in Health Sciences and Technology from Harvard Medical School and MIT. Dr. Butte is a former trainee at NLM&amp;#39;s Biomedical Informatics Training Program at Harvard Medical School and MIT. He is currently the PI on NLM grant 5R01LM009719-04. (Atul J. Butte,Â MD, PhD, Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation, &lt;a href="http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?projectnumber=5R01LM009719-04"&gt;5R01LM009719-04&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;Stanford University.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;White House press release on &amp;#34;Open Science&amp;#34; Champions of Change Awards:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/openscience_release_6-18-13.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/openscience_release_6-18-13.pdf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Library of Medicine (NLM)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;(http://www.nlm.nih.gov) is the world&amp;#39;s largest library of the health sciences and a component of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(http://www.nih.gov).

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) &lt;a href="https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)&lt;/a&gt;, in collaboration with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and Centers for Medicare &amp;#38; Medicaid Services (CMS), has published the annual update for the 2014 Eligible Professional Clinical Quality Measure (CQM) Value Sets. The update includes revised value sets to address deleted and remapped codes in the latest terminology versions, as well as new codes for addressing CQM logic corrections and clarifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value sets provide lists of the numerical values and individual names from standard vocabularies used to define the clinical concepts (e.g., diabetes, clinical visit) used in the CQMs. Â Â The content of the VSAC will gradually expand to incorporate value sets for other use cases, as well as for new measures and updates to existing measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VSAC offers a Downloadable Resource Table (DRT), accessible from the Download tab on the &lt;a href="https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;VSAC&lt;/a&gt; Web page, that provides prepackaged downloads for the most recently updated and released 2014 CQM Value Sets, previously released versions of CQM Value Sets, a table of currently used legacy codes, and catalogs of changes between CQM Value Set releases.Â  Access to the Value Set Authority Center requires a free &lt;a href="https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/license.html"&gt;Unified Medical Language SystemÂ® Metathesaurus License&lt;/a&gt;.Â  NLM also provides the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/healthit/dec/"&gt;Data Element Catalog&lt;/a&gt; that identifies data element names (value set names) required for capture in Electronic Health Record (EHR) technology certified under the 2014 Edition of the ONC Standards and Certification Criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM update of the VSAC coincides with the CMS posting of the official updated 2014 Eligible Professional CQMs.&lt;strong&gt;Â &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014 Clinical Quality Measure Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following resources are available to help health care providers and vendors navigate the 2014 CQMs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NLM:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)&lt;/a&gt;.Â  Provides downloadable access to all official versions of vocabulary value sets contained in the 2014 Clinical Quality Measures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AHRQ&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://ushik.ahrq.gov/downloads/MeaningfulUse?system=mu&amp;#38;enableAsynchronousLoading=true"&gt;United States Healthcare Knowledge Database (USHIK)&lt;/a&gt;.Â  Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality&amp;#39;s Web site with 2014 eCQMs and other health information technology resources.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The NLM&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division has launched a new blog, &lt;a href="http://circulatingnow.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Circulating Now&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to encourage greater exploration and discovery of one of the world&amp;#39;s largest and most treasured history of medicine collections. Encompassing millions of items that span ten centuries, these collections include items in just about every form one can imagineÃ¢ÂÂfrom books, journals, and photographs, to lantern slides, motion picture films, film strips, video tapes, audio recordings, pamphlets, ephemera, portraits, woodcuts, engravings, etchings, and lithographs. The NLM&amp;#39;s historical collections also include items from the present day: born-digital materials and rich data setsÃ¢ÂÂlike the millions of records in its &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/indexcat/ichome.html"&gt;IndexCat&lt;/a&gt; databaseÃ¢ÂÂthat are ripe for exploration through traditional research methods and new ones that are emerging in the current climate of &amp;#34;big data&amp;#34; and the digital humanities.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why &lt;em&gt;Circulating Now?&lt;/em&gt; For over 175 years the NLM&amp;#39;s historical collections have circulated to generations within the reading rooms of its various locations in and around Washington, DC&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Now, these collectionsÃ¢ÂÂas part of the trillions of bytes of data produced and delivered by the world&amp;#39;s largest biomedical libraryÃ¢ÂÂcirculate daily to millions of people around the world. &lt;em&gt;Circulating Now&lt;/em&gt; sustains the tradition and commitment of the NLM, and libraries everywhere, to provide knowledge and expertise freely and to inspire people and enrich lives. &lt;em&gt;Circulating Now&lt;/em&gt; also conveys the vitality of medical history in our 21st-century world: its relevance and importance for research, teaching, and learning about the human condition. And &lt;em&gt;Circulating Now&lt;/em&gt; evokes the living quality of the NLM&amp;#39;s historical collections and the stories they offer about the experience of health and disease here in the United States and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://circulatingnow.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Circulating Now&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will bring the NLM&amp;#39;s diverse historical collections to life in new and exciting ways for researchers, educators, students, and anyone else who is interested in the history of medicine. Whether you are familiar with NLM&amp;#39;s historical collections, or you are discovering them for the first time, &lt;em&gt;Circulating Now&lt;/em&gt; will be an exciting and engaging resource to bookmark, share, and discuss with other readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kicking off &lt;em&gt;Circulating Now &lt;/em&gt;will be a series of posts that draws on the NLM&amp;#39;s historical collections and associated others to reenact in a unique way a tumultuous event in medical and American history which occurred 132 years ago this summer: the assassination of, and attempts to save, our nation&amp;#39;s 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; President, James A. Garfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;ÃÂ &lt;a href="http://circulatingnow.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Circulating Now Home Page" height="389" src="/news/circulating_now.jpg" width="695" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;) is the world&amp;#39;s largest library of the health sciences and a component of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (NIH) (&lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/"&gt;http://www.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;).

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.shadygrove.umd.edu/"&gt;Universities at Shady Grove (USG)&lt;/a&gt;, in partnership with the National Library of Medicine (NLM), will offer five virtual internships to students from the University of Maryland, College Park, College of Information Studies (iSchool) beginning Fall 2013. USG is a campus community of nine leading Maryland universities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virtual internships will span NLM&amp;#39;s research and development initiatives and social media outreach. The projects are:Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessing the quality of automatic classification of NLM customers&amp;#39; requests and corresponding automatically generated responses to customers&amp;#39; requests.&lt;/em&gt; This project will assess the feasibility of providing an automatic reply to some of the thousands of inquiries received annually for changes to MEDLINE/PubMed. Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communication, will serve as mentor and project sponsor.Â &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Should NLM resources be added to Wikipedia? &lt;/em&gt;This project will examine the potential to use Wikipedia as a method of directing the public to NLM web sites through linking of web topics pages. Siobhan Champ-Blackwell, Specialized Information Services Division, will serve as mentor and project sponsor.Â &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creation of a promotional strategy for NLM_HIVplus50 Twitter handle? &lt;/em&gt;This project will assist in the development of a promotional strategy for the @NLM_HIVplus50 a Twitter handle that provides news, updates and resources on HIV/AIDS and aging adults. Andrew Plumer, Specialized Information Services Division, will serve as mentor and project sponsor.Â Â &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creation of a &amp;#34;Tech Tuesday&amp;#34; monthly forum for familiarizing National Library of Medicine (NLM) staff with current emerging and converging technologies. &lt;/em&gt;This project will investigate new technologies and determine which ones would be most useful for a monthly brown bag session. Jamie Peacock, Specialized Information Services Division, will serve as mentor and project sponsor.Â &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social media 360: scanning the landscape of literature to research and provide recommendations for how the National Library of Medicine (NLM) can most effectively use social media to provide health information to the public. &lt;/em&gt;This project will investigate social media platforms and innovative uses of these. Project goals include evaluating the pluses and minuses of NLM Twitter chats; developing a &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; guide for NLM staff wishing to start up new social media outlets; and exploring some of the most popular and successful Facebook pages and Twitter feeds and what they&amp;#39;re doing to communicate their messages and share their information. Melanie Modlin, Office of Communication and Public Liaison, will serve as mentor and project sponsor. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many students close proximity to the many research, corporate and special libraries in the Washington, DC Metro area is misleading given their own professional, student, and family lives. Virtual internships will allow students to tap into the rich and diverse experiences of the world&amp;#39;s largest biomedical library, and to do so at a time and pace convenient to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USG recognizes the challenging lives of active, often working, students. USG provides a convenient location to access the educational offerings of nine University System of Maryland (USM) universities as well as online options for the best and most popular degree programs from the across the state. Virtual internships are part of USG&amp;#39;s forward-thinking approach to meeting the needs of its students and preparing them for careers upon graduation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM has a longstanding commitment to open its collection, products and services to the public. Virtual internships allow NLM to further extend access to include interns who might not otherwise be able to physically spend time at NLM and on the NIH campus. As an institution, NLM has extensive experience in supporting flexiplace and telework options for its own employees and through the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM), working with contracted staff throughout the country. This experience, along with the many students NLM trains through Alternative Spring Breaks, internships, and fellowships, lends itself to offering a rich and robust internship experience virtually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;) is the world&amp;#39;s largest library of the health sciences and a component of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (NIH) (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://www.nih.gov&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;).

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for Nominations:&lt;/strong&gt; As the U.S. Member of the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation (IHTSDO), the National Library of Medicine (NLM) is soliciting nominations of potential candidates for the four IHTSDO Standing Committees Ã¢ÂÂ Content, Quality Assurance, Implementation &amp;#38; Innovation, and Technical. These Committees have important roles in the ongoing development of the SNOMED CT clinical terminology and in the IHTSDO. Nominations are &lt;strong&gt;due to NLM by COB July 29, 2013&lt;/strong&gt; (see details &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/IHTSDONominate2010.html#below"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current roster, terms of reference, and recent reports of each Committee are available on the IHTSDO website (&lt;a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org/index.php?id=530"&gt;http://www.ihtsdo.org/index.php?id=530&lt;/a&gt;).ÃÂ  The Committees are described in &lt;a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Docs_01/About_IHTSDO/Articles_of_Association/Articles_version_12.0_-_final_7420836_1.pdf"&gt;Sections 9.4-9.5 of the Articles of the IHTSDO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly half of each Standing CommitteeÃ¢ÂÂs 12 members are serving terms that expire in December 2013. People elected to these slots will serve for 2 years (Jan. 2014-Dec. 2015). There may be additional Committee vacancies caused by resignations; people elected to fill these mid-term slots will serve for 1 year (Jan-Dec. 2014).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current Committee members whose terms are expiring are eligible for re-nomination to the same committee provided they have not served more than six consecutive years on that committee.ÃÂ  Re-nomination to the same committee is possible after sitting out a minimum of one year from the date they left the Committee.ÃÂ  There is no impediment to a Committee member leaving one Committee and being nominated to another.ÃÂ  Current Committee members eligible for re-nomination must submit a nomination package (see details &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/IHTSDONominate2010.html#below"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Nomination Process:&lt;/strong&gt; All U.S. SNOMED CT Affiliate Licensees (aka, all U.S. UMLS Licensees) may vote to select the U.S. candidates for IHTSDO Committees. The timeline for nominations and elections is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 8 Ã¢ÂÂ July 29:&lt;/strong&gt; NLM accepts nominations of potential candidates for the four IHTSDO Standing Committees. Only candidates with complete nomination packets will be accepted (see &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/IHTSDONominate2010.html#below"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt; for details and required forms). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 5 Ã¢ÂÂ August 26:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. SNOMED CT Affiliates cast votes for their top three candidates for each Standing Committee. Instructions for casting ballots will be sent to U.S. SNOMED CT Affiliates on August 5th. For each Committee, the three candidates receiving the highest number of votes will become the U.S. nominees for the Committee. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 1, 2013:&lt;/strong&gt; NLM will submit the names of the three (3) candidates receiving the highest number of votes as nominees for each of the four Committees to the IHTSDO for consideration by the IHTSDO General Assembly. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 6-11, 2013:&lt;/strong&gt; IHTSDO will announce the final results of the election process during the General Assembly Meeting to be held in conjunction with the IHTSDO Community of Practice Meeting. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Committee Obligations and Participation Logistics:&lt;/strong&gt; English is the official language of the IHTSDO, but Committee Members must be willing to take extra steps to ensure understanding by those for whom English is a second language. Teleconference arrangements are available for all Committee meetings, but, given the geographic distribution of IHTSDO members (currently Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Hong Kong (China), Iceland, Israel, Lithuania, Malaysia, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States, and Uruguay), meeting schedules cannot be convenient for all relevant time zones. The IHTSDO encourages Committee Members to attend at least one of the two major IHTSDO meetings each year in person. Committee Members must participate (either in person or via teleconference) in at least 50% of their CommitteeÃ¢ÂÂs meetings to retain their seat on the Committee. U.S. Committee members may also be called upon to provide advice and input to NLM on matters related to the IHTSDO and SNOMED CT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="below"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submitting your nomination:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Nominations are &lt;strong&gt;due to NLM by COB July 29, 2013&lt;/strong&gt;.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is pleased to announce its next initiative as part of its ongoing &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/partnership_nlm_neh.html"&gt;partnership with the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with &lt;a href="http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh"&gt;NEH&amp;#39;s Office of Digital Humanities&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/"&gt;National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.vt.edu/"&gt;Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech)&lt;/a&gt;, the NLM will be a part of &amp;#34;An Epidemiology of Information: New Methods for Interpreting Disease and Data,&amp;#34; an interdisciplinary symposium exploring new methods for large-scale data analysis of epidemic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scheduled to take place at the Virginia Tech Research Center in Arlington, VA, on October 17, 2013, from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM, &amp;#34;An Epidemiology of Information&amp;#34; will be a unique public forum through which policy makers, public health experts, and scholars can address pressing questions about how new methods of analyzing large-scale datasets can inform research and policy approaches to epidemic disease. Panelists will consider what these new methods suggest for contemporary infodemiology and epidemic intelligence as well as the implications of data mining as a disease surveillance mechanism and how new forms of reporting and public health surveillance affect public health policy. The symposium will also explore how these new methods can inform research on the 1918 influenza pandemic and help to answer lingering questions about the spread of the disease, its pathogenicity, the unusual mortality rates, or the effectiveness of public health responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featured speakers will include Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger, Chief, Viral Pathogenesis and Evolution Section, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and Dr. David Morens, Senior Advisor to the Director, NIAID, whose research in data analysis and historical epidemiology has influenced the approaches being adopted and adapted by digital humanities scholars working in the history of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;An Epidemiology of Information&amp;#34; is made possible in part from support received by Virginia Tech through the international &lt;a href="http://www.diggingintodata.org/"&gt;Digging into Data Challenge&lt;/a&gt; competition sponsored by NEH. Funding for Virginia Tech&amp;#39;s Canadian partner, the Center for E-Health Initiatives of the University of Toronto, comes from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NLM&amp;#39;s participation in &amp;#34;An Epidemiology of Information&amp;#34; follows its involvement, earlier this year, in &amp;#34;Shared Horizons: Data, Biomedicine, and the Digital Humanities,&amp;#34; an interdisciplinary symposium exploring the intersection of digital humanities and biomedicine supported by the&lt;a href="http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh"&gt; NEH&amp;#39;s Office of Digital Humanities&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://mith.umd.edu/"&gt;Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities at the University of Maryland&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/Pages/Home.aspx"&gt;Research Councils UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;An Epidemiology of Information&amp;#34; is free and open to the public, but registration is required.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Thelma Golden Charen, former indexer, trainer in the Index Section and senior technical advisor in the MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) Section of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) died July 14, 2013 in Bethesda, MD, one day shy of her 97th birthday. Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Charen first joined the Army Medical Library (precursor of the Armed Forces Medical Library and ultimately, the National Library of Medicine) in 1944 as a pre-cataloger in the Acquisitions Section. She had degrees in Greek and Latin; her natural facility with these languages led to her mastery of medical terminology and to positions as Indexer, training specialist for indexers and searchers, manual developer, and vocabulary specialist. She retired in 1997, ending a renowned 53-year career at NLM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Charen was notably awarded the Marcia C. Noyes Award, highest professional distinction offered by the Medical Library Association in 1985, as an acknowledgement of a career that resulted in lasting, outstanding contributions to health sciences librarianship. At the awards ceremony, Lois Ann Colaianni, then NLM Associate Director for Library Operations, commented, &amp;#34;Her wit and spontaneity in the classroom are as legendary as her logic. She has trained an entire generation of medical indexers working at NLM and around the world. It is not an exaggeration to say that the success of &lt;em&gt;Index Medicus&lt;/em&gt; and the MEDLARS system is in great measure the result of Mrs. Charen&amp;#39;s high standards for the quality indexing of the biomedical literature.&amp;#34; At the same ceremony, current NLM Deputy Director Betsy Humphreys recalls that when Mrs. Colaianni asked all those present who had been taught online searching by Mrs. Charen to raise their hands, the vast majority of those in the room did so, including all members of the MLA Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Charen also received two awards given to staff: the NLM Director&amp;#39;s Award in 1983 and the Regents&amp;#39; Award for Scholarship or Technical Achievement in 1972 &amp;#34;for conceiving, developing and implementing the MEDLARS indexing manual and training program.&amp;#34;Â Â Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amongst her other achievements, Mrs. Charen also:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Authored or co-authored numerous publications on indexing, training for indexers, and manuals used by librarians all over the world, including &lt;em&gt;Structure and Use of Medical Subject Headings: Annotations&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Medical Subject Headings; Tree Annotations&lt;/em&gt;. Mrs. Charen wrote every MeSH annotation for indexers and online searchers for over 20 years; and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Served on the three-person task force, along with James L. Wood of the Chemical Abstracts Service, and Harold Oatfield of Pfizer Medical Research Laboratories to revise the ANSI Z39.5 standard for journal title abbreviations, resulting in the 1969 publication of the &lt;em&gt;American National Standard for the Abbreviation of Titles of Periodicals&lt;/em&gt;.Â &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a mark of Mrs. Charen&amp;#39;s great love of the National Library of Medicine and its staff that during her lifetime she and her husband, Sol Charen, anonymously endowed NLM&amp;#39;s Frank Bradway Rogers Award. The award, given annually, is presented to an individual who has made a significant contribution to the Library&amp;#39;s fundamental operational programs and services. Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Charen&amp;#39;s career covered the time from when the Library began indexing articles for the print publication, &lt;em&gt;Index Medicus&lt;/em&gt;, and through development of accessibility of journal citations in the online database MEDLINE/PubMed. Today, indexers index over 750,000 citations annually for MEDLINE/PubMed from over 5,600 biomedical journals. MEDLINE contains over 20,000,000 citations to the biomedical literature. Where indexing the literature was once a process entirely handled manually, today 93% of citations are submitted electronically in XML format by publishers, enabling NLM to concentrate on quality control and indexing rather than original creation of the bibliographic citation and indexers index 74% of MEDLINE journals from the online version which accounts for 88% of all new citations being processed. The Index Section now also uses in production the Medical Text Indexer (MTI), a software indexing assistant tool that is optimized to suggest precise MeSH headings from analyzing the article title and abstract for the indexer to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;img alt="Thelma Golden Charen" src="/news/thelma_charen.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition to her considerable professional skills, Thelma Charen was known for a seemingly endless supply of dramatic eyeglass frames.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The National Library of Medicine is the world&amp;#39;s largest library of the health sciences and a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH.) NLM collects, organizes, and makes available biomedical science information to scientists, health professionals, and the public.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;National Library of Medicine (NLM)&lt;/a&gt; announces the release of about 1,800 new high quality images of solid oral dosage medications. Images were taken at high resolution, but are also available in smaller sizes if desired for certain applications. Researchers and product developers may obtain the images and accompanying metadata via an applications programming interface (API) at &lt;a href="http://RxImage.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;http://RxImage.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;. NLM also makes the images available for interactive Web searching via its &lt;a href="http://pillbox.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;Pillbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;RxNav&lt;/a&gt; sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;&amp;#34;This project builds on NLM&amp;#39;s long history of research and development in image processing,&amp;#34; explained NLM Director Donald A.B. Lindberg, MD. &amp;#34;If history is any guide, many innovators will find interesting applications for this body of images and put them to creative use right away. The new image collection could speed the development of algorithms to identify pills based on photos taken on mobile devices, for example. We will continue to expand the collection,&amp;#34; Dr. Lindberg continued, &amp;#34;encouraging manufacturers to send us more products to be imaged.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;Of the roughly 1,800 pills photographed to date, approximately 400 were provided by manufacturers. The others were purchased through a licensed Maryland pharmacy. NLM estimates that the images cover about 15 percent of the more than 10,000 solid dosage forms of the 4,075 human prescription medications on the US market, and a higher percentage of frequently prescribed medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;The FDAÃ¢ÂÂs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) provided provide technical advice, funding and in-kind support for the development of the photography standards for these pills, the establishment of an imaging facility and the performance of some image capture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Computational Photography Project for Pill Identification (C3PI) project" border="1" src="/news/pill_imaging_project.jpg" /&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caption:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With its Computational Photography Project for Pill Identification (C3PI) and Pillbox projects, NLM computer scientists have developed standards for photography of pills, including camera angle, lighting and the digital data processing often found in digital cameras.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; is the world&amp;#39;s largest library of the health sciences and a component of the &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH).

The Medical Text Indexer (MTI), a system for producing indexing recommendations, assists in the indexing process at NLM. The BioASQ challenge is a series of challenges on biomedical semantic indexing and question answering with the aim of advancing the state of the art accessibility for researchers and clinicians to biomedical text. The MTI indexing results are providing one of the baselines used in the &amp;#34;Large-scale online biomedical semantic indexing&amp;#34; part of the challenge, which is designed to parallel the human indexing currently being done at NLM. Alan R. Aronson, PhD, Principal Investigator for the MTI project also will be delivering an invited talk on &amp;#34;&lt;em&gt;Indexing The Biomedical Literature In A Time Of Increased Demand And Limited Resources&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#34; at the BioASQ Workshop in September.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;First Public Education Film about Cancer Restored in Collaboration with Library of Congress&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) today announced the digital release of &lt;em&gt;The Reward of Courage&lt;/em&gt;, a 1921 silent film long believed to have been lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Produced by the American Society for the Control of Cancer (the ASCC, later renamed the American Cancer Society), and funded by a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, &lt;em&gt;The Reward of Courage&lt;/em&gt; is a melodrama in the grand silent-era tradition. The film pits charlatans who promise cures through the use of quack salves and pastes against the forces of scientific medicine and the U.S. postal authorities, who crack down on such fraudulent and dangerous claims. This battle of good versus evil unfolds against a tender love story: the coming together of two young lovers is threatened by the mistaken belief that cancer is an inheritable disease and would afflict the offspring of their union. In fact, we now know that a predisposition to get certain forms of cancer can be inherited, but no reliable research on this had been done in the early twentieth century. The film calls for the establishment of clinics in industrial workplaces, to promote worker health and higher productivity, and provides what is likely the first representation in film of a breast examination for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discovered in the film collections of the Library of Congress, &lt;em&gt;The Reward of Courage&lt;/em&gt; was meticulously restored through cooperation between the NLM and the Library of Congress, transferred from its unstable nitrate base, and augmented with a musical soundtrack for the film, following the traditional silent-film practice of screening films with live musical accompaniment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the NLM announced the digital release of both the original, silent version of &lt;em&gt;The Reward of Courage&lt;/em&gt; and the newly-scored version, on the NLM&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/collections/films/medicalmoviesontheweb/index.html"&gt;Medical Movies on the Web&lt;/a&gt;, a curated portal featuring selected motion pictures from the NLM&amp;#39;s world-renowned collection of over 30,000 audiovisual titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the motion pictures featured on &lt;em&gt;Medical Movies on the Web&lt;/em&gt;, and others from the NLM&amp;#39;s audiovisual collection, are also available through the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7dF9e2qSW0bv--6anMWu-gq7LlVpUhBX"&gt;NLM&amp;#39;s YouTube site&lt;/a&gt; and through its &lt;a href="http://collections.nlm.nih.gov/muradora/"&gt;Digital Collections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Images from the collection" height="167" src="/news/reward_of_courage.jpg" width="915" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Images from &lt;em&gt;The Reward of Courage&lt;/em&gt; (1921): (left) Miss Keene, the nurse at Dr. Dale&amp;#39;s clinic, examines Anna Flint. This is probably the first cinematic representation of a breast examination for cancer; (middle) Hidden behind a curtain, Morris Maxwell overhears a conversation about Anna&amp;#39;s cancer diagnosis before offering Anna a painless Ã¢ÂÂcure&amp;#39; for the disease for $200.00-his Radiumized Paste; and (right) Part of the animated section of the film showing the spread of cancer and its consequences, highlighted by arrows. The line drawing of the human figure and dark blotches of the tumors also serve to counter the prospect of any paralyzing fear or disgust that might be evoked by a live action image of tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Library of Congress, the nation&amp;#39;s oldest federal cultural institution, is the world&amp;#39;s preeminent reservoir of knowledge, providing unparalleled collections and integrated resources to Congress and the American people. The Library holds the largest collection of audiovisual recordings in the world and has been collecting and preserving historically, culturally and aesthetically significant recordings in all genres for nearly 120 years. Many of the Library&amp;#39;s rich resources and treasures may also be accessed through the Library&amp;#39;s Web site, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.loc.gov"&gt;&lt;em&gt;www.loc.gov&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is the world&amp;#39;s largest library of the health sciences and a component of the National Institutes of Health.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;F. W. &amp;#34;Wilf&amp;#34; Lancaster, professor emeritus at the University of Illinois Graduate School of Library and Information Science and former NLM employee, passed away on Sunday, August 25, 2013 in Urbana, Illinois. Wilf&amp;#39;s contributions to the NLM in the early days of automated information retrieval have had a lasting impact on our information systems and services.ÃÂ  His work as a professor and mentor also benefited the Library, as he led many fine graduate students to pursue careers at the NLM. With his passing, NLM remembers a colleague and friend.ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilf earned a reputation for greatness in the evaluation of information storage and retrieval systems, based in part on his early experience with a comprehensive evaluation of NLM&amp;#39;s MEDLARS (MEDical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System). The evaluation of the MEDLARS Demand Search Service in 1966 and 1967 was one of the earliest evaluations of a computer-based retrieval system and the first application of recall and precision measures in a large, operational database setting. The use of computers for bibliographic retrieval systems was in its infancy, and many of the extant systems were small or experimental. Planning for the evaluation began in December 1965, when Wilf joined the NLM staff as Information Systems Evaluator. Following completion of the MEDLARS evaluation, he developed NLM training programs in his roles as Deputy Chief of the Bibliographic Services Division and Special Assistant to the Associate Director for Library Operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1970-1971, Wilf conducted an evaluation of the MEDLARS AIM-TWX system, an innovative experimental service that was the precursor of MEDLINE/PubMed. This was an important study of early online systems and their direct use by end users. Written more than 40 years ago, his report reflects his signature forward-thinking attitude toward system design, as relevant today as then: &amp;#34;We should always look for ways of improving retrieval systems and making them more attractive to potential users. The philosophy that Ã¢ÂÂthe system is used, therefore it is good&amp;#39; is a very shallow one. We must not assume that a system having appeal today will always retain this appeal....novelty wears off and system designers cannot afford to rest too long on their laurels. In the past, users have been required to adapt to the information system. In the future systems must be designed that adapt to the users.&amp;#34;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For further information on Wilf&amp;#39;s extraordinary accomplishments and influence, see the Festschrift published in his honor by &lt;em&gt;Library Trends&lt;/em&gt; in 2008, Essays Honoring the Legacy of F. W. Lancaster, (Volume 56, Issue 4) at https://ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/9483. One of the articles, entitled &amp;#34;Excellence in Evaluation: Early Landmarks at the National Library of Medicine,&amp;#34; focuses on his work at NLM and was used as the source for the above summary of contributions to NLM.ÃÂ  His &lt;a href="http://www.renner-wikoffchapel.com/fh/obituaries/obituary.cfm?o_id=2204062&amp;#38;fh_id=10562"&gt;obituary&lt;/a&gt; is available online at: &lt;a href="http://www.news-gazette.com/obituaries/2013-08-28/frederick-lancaster.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.news-gazette.com/obituaries/2013-08-28/frederick-lancaster.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"&gt;&lt;img alt="F.W.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine has launched a traveling banner exhibition and &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/survivingandthriving/"&gt;online adaptation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Surviving and Thriving: AIDS, Politics, and Culture&lt;/em&gt;, an exploration of the rise of AIDS in the early 1980&amp;#39;s and the evolving response to the epidemic over the last 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1981, a new disease appeared in the United States. Reactions to the disease, soon named AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), varied. The exhibition illustrates an iconic history of AIDS alongside lesser-known examples of historical figures who changed the course of the pandemic. Utilizing a variety of historic photographs, pamphlets, and publications, &lt;em&gt;Surviving and Thriving&lt;/em&gt; is divided into five historical investigations, each of which highlights how different groups responded to AIDS. Early responders cared for the sick, fought homophobia, and promoted new practices to keep people healthy. Scientists and public health officials struggled to understand the disease and how it spread. Politicians remained largely silent until the epidemic became too big to ignore. Activists demanded that people with AIDS be part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title &lt;em&gt;Surviving and Thriving&lt;/em&gt; comes from a book written in 1987 by and for people with AIDS that insisted people could live with AIDS, not just die from it. Jennifer Brier, PhD (University of Illinois at Chicago), the exhibition&amp;#39;s curator, explains that, &amp;#34;centering the experience of people with AIDS in the exhibition allows us to see how critical they were, and continue to be, in the political and medical fight against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS.&amp;#34; This exhibition presents their stories alongside those of others involved in the national AIDS crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companion website includes an extensive selection of NLM&amp;#39;s diverse poster collection about HIV/AIDS. This &amp;#34;Digital Gallery&amp;#34; displays 238 posters grouped into fifteen thematic clusters, providing viewers new historical avenues to explore beyond the exhibition. Brier sees these as invaluable resources for multiple audiences: &amp;#34;not only will these visual materials be incredibly useful for teachers interested in engaging students in historical thinking about HIV/AIDS, but they will also allow the general public to learn more about how public health efforts relied on graphic design and imagery to effect behavior change.&amp;#34; The website is augmented by education resources that investigate the exhibition content, including two lesson plans for grades 10-12; three six-class higher education modules; and two online activities. In addition, a selection of published landmark HIV/AIDS articles are provided by NLM&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"&gt;PubMed Central&lt;/a&gt;, which freely provides access to over 2.8 million life science journal articles and modern day information is provided by &lt;a href="http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/"&gt;AIDSInfo/InfoSIDA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early stops for the traveling banner exhibition include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Public Health Library Information Center, Atlanta, GA; Gay Men&amp;#39;s Health Crisis, New York, NY; University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; University of Colorado, Denver, Aurora, CO, and the University of Illinois at Chicago Library of Health Sciences, Chicago, IL.

The short manifesto described ways for men to be affectionate and sexual while dramatically lessening the risk of spreading and contracting AIDS. This booklet was one of the first times men were told to use condoms when having sex with other men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnB" style="width:50%;"&gt;&lt;div class="caption_center"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Robert C.

Scientists later determined it was the same virus identified as LAV (lymphadenopathy-associated virus) by Dr. Luc Montagnier and his team at the Pasteur Institute a year earlier. Despite disagreement over who made the initial discovery, French and American researchers eventually agreed to share the credit. In 1986, the virus was renamed HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). Identifying a viral cause enabled the scientific community to develop a test for HIV and better confront AIDS with treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div class="items"&gt;&lt;div class="columnA" style="width:45%;"&gt;&lt;div class="caption_center"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="oster for Department of Health and Human Services demonstration designed by ACT UP/DC Women&amp;#39;s Committee, 1990" src="/news/women_aids.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poster for Department of Health and Human Services demonstration designed by ACT UP/DC Women&amp;#39;s Committee, 1990 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtesy National Library of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 1990, ACT UP descended upon Washington and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, carrying signs that demanded the formal definition of AIDS change to include women. Excluded from the diagnosis of having AIDS, women could not access potentially lifesaving care and treatment, even as they died of the disease. By 1992, activists succeeded in their efforts: women were officially recognized as people who could have AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnB" style="width:50%;"&gt;&lt;div class="caption_center"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ask for the Test&amp;#34; poster, 2012" src="/news/ask_test.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#34;Ask for the Test&amp;#34; poster, 2012&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtesy HAHSTA (HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STD, TB Administration), District of Columbia Department of Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 21st century, testing for HIV is the first line of defense in the battle against AIDS. But when the test was released in 1985, many people refused for fear that their names would go on a registry to deny them health care. Municipal unions in Washington, DC, are at the forefront of fighting this persistent myth and explaining how testing helps keep people healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is pleased to be a part of a new exhibition on view until November 23, 2013 at &lt;a href="http://www.grolierclub.org/"&gt;The Grolier Club&lt;/a&gt; in New York City.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designed and curated to interest a wide audience, &lt;em&gt;Extraordinary Women in Science and Medicine: Four Centuries of Achievement&lt;/em&gt; opens a window onto the stories behind the careers and accomplishments of women in science since the mid-seventeenth century. The exhibition will focus on the women from viewpoints such as educational opportunities or lack thereof, career choice issues, gender discrimination, role models, and hidden factors that influenced recognition or lack of recognition. Events planned in conjunction with the exhibition will include invited lectures, lectures by the Curators, and opportunities for mentored visits. There will be a catalogue including invited essays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Established in 1884, the Grolier Club is America&amp;#39;s oldest and largest society for bibliophiles and enthusiasts in the graphic arts. The Club is named after Jean Grolier, the French Renaissance collector renowned for sharing his library with friends. The Grolier Club&amp;#39;s objective is to foster appreciation for books and prints, their art, history, production, and commerce. As part of this mission the Grolier Club maintains a library, mounts exhibitions, publishes books, and hosts lectures and symposia. In its 125-year history the Club has organized more than five hundred such exhibitions on topics ranging from Blake to Kipling, from chess to murder mysteries, from Japanese prints to Art Nouveau posters. There are four shows a year in the Club&amp;#39;s main ground floor gallery, all open to the public free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featured in the Grolier Clubs &lt;em&gt;Extraordinary Women in Science and Medicine: Four Centuries of Achievement &lt;/em&gt;are three items from the NLM&amp;#39;s collections, two works by Louise Bourgeois BoursierÃ¢ÂÂ&lt;em&gt;Observations diverses, sur la sterilitÃÂ©, perte de fruict, foeconditÃÂ©, accouchements, et maladies des femmes, et enfants nouveaux naiz &lt;/em&gt;(1617) and &lt;em&gt;The Compleat midwife&amp;#39;s practice enlarged&lt;/em&gt; (1663) and &amp;#34;Recherches quantitatives sur la marche du processus de diffÃÂ©renciation des neurones dans les ganglions spinaux de l&amp;#39;embryon de Poulet, (1943)&amp;#34; co-authored by Rita Levi-Montalcini and her husband Giuseppe Levi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boursier&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Observations &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compleat midwife&amp;#39;s practice &lt;/em&gt;are, respectively, the French original and an English translation (both 17th century) of the first extensive textbook on midwifery written by a woman.ÃÂ  Mme. Bourgeois Boursier ÃÂ (1563Ã¢ÂÂ1636) was midwife to Marie de Medicis, wife of Henry IV, King of France, and delivered six children for the queen, all of whom survived to adulthood, including one future king of France, two queens (England and Spain), two dukes and a duchess. Her book was reprinted many times and widely translated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rita Levi-Montalcini (1909Ã¢ÂÂ2012) won the Nobel Prize in 1986 for her work in neurology, specifically working on the growth of nerve fibers. As a Jew in Italy in the 1930s and 1940s, she worked under the constant threat of arrest and imprisonment by the Fascist regimes that controlled her home country.ÃÂ  Nevertheless, she continued to work in a makeshift lab in her kitchen in Turin, measuring nerve development in chicken embryos.ÃÂ  Levi-Montalcini&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;Recherches quantitatives,&amp;#34; a seminal article which summarizes her work, could not be published in Italy, and somehow made it into print in Liege instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levi-Montalcini never left Italy during the war, although she and her family fled south to Florence and she eventually worked as a physician with the Allied forces. In 1946, she emigrated to the United States, where she continued her research at Washington University and then jointly in Rome at the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche. She remained active in both medicine and politics until her death in 2012, at the age of 103.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Observations diverses, sur la sterilitÃÂ©, perte de fruict, foeconditÃÂ©, accouchements, et maladies des femmes, et enfants nouveaux naiz &lt;/em&gt;(1617)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="center_all"&gt;&lt;div class="items"&gt;&lt;div class="columnA" style="width:45%;"&gt;&lt;div class="caption_center"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ÃÂ &lt;img alt="Title page of the 1617 edition (in French)" src="/news/grolier1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Title page of the 1617 edition (in French)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnB" style="width:50%;"&gt;&lt;div class="caption_center"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Frontispiece portrait of Marie de Medicis, Queen of France, and Bourgeois Boursier&amp;#39;s patron and best customer, from the 1617 French edition." src="/news/grolier2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontispiece portrait of Marie de Medicis, Queen of France, and Bourgeois Boursier&amp;#39;s patron and best customer, from the 1617 French edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Compleat midwife&amp;#39;s practice enlarged&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="center_all"&gt;&lt;div class="items"&gt;&lt;div class="columnA" style="width:45%;"&gt;&lt;div class="caption_center"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Title page of the 1663 English translation" src="/news/grolier3.jpg" /&gt;ÃÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Title page of the 1663 English translation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnB" style="width:50%;"&gt;&lt;div class="caption_center2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Two-page spread showing the different ways a fetus can present, from the 1663 English edition" src="/news/grolier4_larger.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two-page spread showing the different ways a fetus can present, from the 1663 English edition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#34;Recherches quantitatives sur la marche du processus de diffÃÂ©renciation des neurones dans les ganglions spinaux de l&amp;#39;embryon de Poulet&amp;#34; (1943)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_center3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="Summary graph charting the growth of nerve fibers in chicken embryos, largely compiled from work done in Levi Montalcini&amp;#39;s kitchen/laboratory in Turin." src="/news/grolier6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summary graph charting the growth of nerve fibers in chicken embryos, largely compiled from work done in Levi Montalcini&amp;#39;s kitchen/laboratory in Turin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Although parts of the collection were not digitized due to the patient privacy, privacy of Kolb&amp;#39;s coworkers, and copyright concerns around specific documents, the entire collection is available to researchers at the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complete finding aid for the Kolb papers is &lt;a href="http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/kolb"&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; free from the National Library of Medicine, and researchers are cordially invited to visit the Library to consult the collection directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lawrence Kolb was born in Galesville, Maryland, on February 20, 1881, and graduated from the University of Maryland medical school in 1908. The next year he was commissioned an Assistant Surgeon in the Public Health Service. From 1913 to 1919, he was stationed at the Ellis Island, New York Immigration Station specializing in the mental disease and illness of incoming immigrants. During this same period, he also developed a program for the study and treatment of post-World War I patients suffering from war-caused neuroses. In 1923, Dr. Kolb came to Washington, D.C. and spent five years studying drug addiction and its relationship to crime. He was one of the first to advocate treating drug addicts as patients, not criminals. By 1934, Dr. Kolb was an international expert in the study of psychiatry and narcotics, and was appointed head of the &lt;a href="http://ihm.nlm.nih.gov/luna/servlet/s/7ir76p"&gt;Public Health Service Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; to lead the U.S. government&amp;#39;s first experimental unit for treating drug addicts. His final duty station was as Chief of the Public Health Service Mental Hygiene Division from 1938Ã¢ÂÂ1944. He was promoted to Assistant Surgeon General in 1942. His work there, along with that of Dr. Thomas Parran, led to the creation of the National Institute for Mental Health in 1946.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is the world&amp;#39;s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;largest library of the health sciences a&lt;em&gt;nd a component of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

These enhancements document Dr. Cummings&amp;#39;s opinion that the testimonies and commentaries together offer the most valuable window into NLM&amp;#39;s program development from the 1960s to the 1980s. Reflecting on his testimonies, and the subsequent question and answer sessions defending them, Dr. Cummings&amp;#39;s commentary provides contextual insight on significant turning points in the Library&amp;#39;s history and the political personalities that influenced them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/cummings_death_notice.html"&gt;Martin Marc Cummings, MDÃÂ (1920Ã¢ÂÂ2011)&lt;/a&gt;, was a medical educator, physician, scientific administrator and medical librarian.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine has released an enhancement to &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/connect/overview.html"&gt;MedlinePlus Connect&lt;/a&gt;, NLM&amp;#39;s service for patient portals and electronic health record (EHR) systems.Â  MedlinePlusÂ Connect makes it easy for EHRs to link to targeted information for patients from MedlinePlus, using their existing coding for diagnoses (problem codes), medications, and laboratory test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest enhancement provides responses to one code system for problems, SNOMED CT, to information from NLM&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;Genetics Home Reference&lt;/a&gt; (GHR) web site.Â  GHR is the NLM&amp;#39;s web site for consumer information about genetic conditions and the genes or chromosomes related to those conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this new enhancement, MedlinePlus Connect can respond to requests for information related to SNOMED CT codes with information from MedlinePlus and from GHR. Currently this feature is available only for English SNOMED CT requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is the world&amp;#39;s largest library of the health sciences and a component of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

Major Owens&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major Owens, a long-time member of the US House of Representatives and the first professional librarian to serve in Congress died October 21, 2013. He was 77.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good friend of the National Library of Medicine and of libraries in general, Owens represented a Brooklyn, New York congressional district from 1983 to 2007. Among other achievements, he was credited with helping pass the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was known as the &amp;#34;Education Congressman&amp;#34; because of his dedication to passing laws to give disadvantaged students in public schools access to computers so that they would have equal access to economic opportunity in the workplace. He was also known as the &amp;#34;Rapping Congressman&amp;#34; because he often wrote his positions on important issues in the form of rap poetry, and rapped before Congress. (In fact, an interactive virtual dialogue program in the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/vcenter.html"&gt;NLM Visitor Center&lt;/a&gt; includes video clips of him rapping, along with his thoughts on many public policy issues.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major Owens appeared at NLM twice during his congressional service. He spoke at the Library&amp;#39;s observance of African American History Month on February 19, 1991 and also addressed the NLM staff on April 26, 1983, pointing out the importance of upgrading the role of the librarian in society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of his 1983 comments were in response to the US Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76, which dealt with contracting out services in federal agencies. He described his vision of the information provider within an organization as someone who is very close to the decision making process, as someone who understands the goals and needs of the decision makers, and as someone who asks the right questions, sees relationship between bits of information gathered, and looks for information gaps that need filling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quote from this appearance, in the June 1983 issue of &lt;em&gt;NLM News&lt;/em&gt;, crystallizes Cong. Owens&amp;#39; thoughts on the importance of librarians and other information professionals: &amp;#34;How can we make people understand that information is vital for decision making? Unless you have information provided by people who are able to get the best that&amp;#39;s available and to sort out and prioritize, then you&amp;#39;re not going to be able to make decisions in the most efficient and effective way.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major Owens was born in Collierville Tennessee on June 28, 1936. He earned a bachelor&amp;#39;s degree from Morehouse College and a master&amp;#39;s of library science at Atlanta University. Owens worked as a librarian at the Brooklyn Public Library before entering politics.Â  In the 1960s, Owens served in the administration of New York City Major John Lindsay, focusing on anti-poverty programs. He was elected to the state senate in 1974 and subsequently elected to the US House in 1982.Â Â  After leaving Capitol Hill, Major Owens taught in the Department of Public Administration at Brooklyn&amp;#39;s Medgar Evers College.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is the world&amp;#39;s largest library of the health sciences and a component of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NCBI Director Dr. David Lipman Receives Jim Gray eScience Award for Center&amp;#39;s Accomplishments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;November 2013 marks 25&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;years that the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) has been providing access to biomedical and genomic information to advance science and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Established in 1988 as a division of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), NCBI has grown into a leading source for public biomedical databases, software tools for analyzing molecular and genomic data, and research in computational biology. NCBI&amp;#39;s resources rank among the most heavily used government Web sites in the United States, with approximately 3 million users every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recognition of NCBI&amp;#39;s achievements, an awards and recognition program was held November 1 on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. At that event Tony Hey, PhD, Vice President of Microsoft Research, presented NCBI Director David Lipman, MD, with the Jim Gray eScience Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Named for Jim Gray, a technical fellow for Microsoft Research and an A.M. Turing Award winner who disappeared at sea in 2007, the annual award recognizes researchers who have made outstanding contributions to the field of data-intensive computing and made &amp;#34;science easier for scientists,&amp;#34; according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;David Lipman and the outstanding staff at NCBI have had a tremendous impact on the amount of biomedical and health information that are publically and easily available to drive scientific discovery, to help clinicians and patients, and to promote the development of innovative services for the benefit of science and health,&amp;#34; Dr. Hey said in presenting the award to Dr. Lipman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gray was very familiar with the work of NCBI. He was a member of the NLM Board of Regents in 2006 and met a number of times with Dr. Lipman, NCBI Information Engineering Branch Chief Jim Ostell, PhD, and other staff to discuss issues such as organization of and access to biomedical literature and data. His interest in NCBI&amp;#39;s work is evidenced by his final lecture, in January 2007, in which he highlighted the importance of NCBI/NLM biomedical literature databases like PubMed and PubMed Central, genomic databases such as GenBank, and NCBI&amp;#39;s Entrez system for searching across these and many other databases. (An edited version of Gray&amp;#39;s lecture can be read in The Fourth Paradigm, available &lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/focus/escience/jim-gray-award.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on Microsoft Research&amp;#39;s Web site).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NCBI awards program also featured presentations by Sir Richard Roberts, PhD, chief scientific officer of New England Biolabs, who provided the keynote address, entitled &amp;#34;A personal recollection of GenBank and NCBI.&amp;#34; NLM Director Donald A.B.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special Display, Traveling Banner Exhibition to Debut November 18, 2013&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM), in cooperation with the Smithsonian&amp;#39;s National Museum of American History, launches a special display in the History of Medicine Division Reading Room, a traveling banner exhibition made available free of charge to cultural institutions across the country, and an &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/fromdnatobeer/index.html"&gt;online adaptation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;From DNA to Beer: Harnessing Nature in Medicine and Industry. From DNA to Beer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;explores some of the processes, problems, and potentials inherent in technologies that use life. The display will be installed at NLM, on the Bethesda, Maryland campus of the National Institutes of Health, from November 18, 2013 through April 18, 2014. (Visitor information appears at the foot of this release.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MicrobesÃ¢ÂÂtiny organisms too small to be seen with the naked eyeÃ¢ÂÂhave altered human history. Life forms such as bacteria, yeasts, and molds can cause sickness or restore health, and help produce foods and beverages for our consumption. Scientists, in partnership with industry, have developed techniques to harness the powers of these microbes. In recent years, headline-grabbing technologies have used genetically modified bacteria to manufacture new medicines. Drawing from the collections of the National Museum of American History and the National Library of Medicine, &lt;em&gt;From DNA to Beer &lt;/em&gt;will help to promote public understanding of the dynamic relationship between microbes, technology, and science and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, biotechnology (or &amp;#34;biotech&amp;#34;) is most often associated with recent developments in genetic engineering, the science of directly manipulating DNA. But technologies that utilize organisms, especially yeast and other microorganisms, have been around for thousands of years, forming the basis for brewing beer, fermenting wine, and making bread. Only in the past two centuries, however, has the scientific basis for these technologies emerged. One result has been the fundamental role of laboratory science in medicine and pharmacy, which has led to a host of new therapies, from the serums and vaccines of the 19th century to the recombinant drugs of today. Through these commercial products, the public encounters a powerful partnership of science and industry, inherent in all modern biotechnologies. In turn, the availability of these products poses a challenge to society, as their manufacture and use have consequences both biological and ethical concerning the nature of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From DNA to Beer &lt;/em&gt;includes a selection of artifacts from the collections of the National Museum of American History and the National Library of Medicine that illuminate relationships between science, industry, and the public in historical context. Four case studies will be presented: the recent use of recombinant DNA in drug production; the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; of penicillin and consequences of its access and overuse; the relationship of microbes, mammals, and people inherent in serum therapy; and the work of Pasteur and his relationship to the brewing and wine-making industry. The companion website will allow visitors to explore the artifacts along with additional texts and documents to gain a better understanding of the historical period during which these products were created and distributed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unique exhibition will be open to the public in the History of Medicine Division Reading Room (NIH Building 38, first floor) November 18, 2013 to April 18, 2014. &lt;em&gt;From DNA to Beer: Harnessing Nature in Medicine and Industry &lt;/em&gt;was curated by Diane Wendt and Malory Warner from the Division of Medicine and Science, National Museum of American History.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traveling banner exhibition is available for booking. Please visit the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/about/exhibition/fromdnatobeer-bookinfo.html"&gt;traveling exhibition services Web site&lt;/a&gt; for more information about &lt;em&gt;From DNA to Beer: Harnessing Nature in Medicine and Industry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is the world&amp;#39;s largest library of the health sciences and home to the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;National Center for Biotechnology Information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, one of the key government organizations focusing on genetics information. NLM is a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and is located on the campus of the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland. The library is open Monday through Friday from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM, and its vast online resources are available free to the world at &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.

This 10-foot case features lab and factory equipment used to produce recombinant insulin shown alongside historic objects used for managing and treating diabetes from the 1930s to the 1980s. The museum is located on Constitution Avenue between 12th and 14th Streets NW and is open daily from 10:00 AM to 5:30 PM. Admission is free.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Sir William Osler (1849Ã¢ÂÂ1919) was the best-known physician of his era. Today, he is recognized as one of the founders of modern science-based medicine. Born to Anglican missionaries in the Canadian frontier territory north of Toronto, Ontario, Osler was inspired to pursue a medical career by two early mentors, a clergyman and a physician who introduced him to natural science and to humanistic literature. When he began his training in 1868, few American medical schools included courses in laboratory sciences or required that students work with actual patients; standards of medical practice were often loose, and physician competence varied widely. During his long career, Osler was a driving force in modernizing medical practice and education. Among many other achievements, he revolutionized American medical education with the clinical internship program he instituted at the new Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, in which senior students worked in hospital wards full time to &amp;#34;learn medicine at the bedside.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now available from the National Library of Medicine (NLM), the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and a constituent institute of the National Institutes of Health, is an extensive selection of digitized materials from the papers of Sir William Osler. This presentation is made possible in collaboration with the &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/library/branches/osler"&gt;Osler Library of the History of Medicine at McGill University&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.medicalarchives.jhmi.edu/"&gt;Alan Mason Chesney Medical Archives of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are repositories of William Osler collections. The &lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/GF"&gt;William Osler Papers&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;Profiles in ScienceÃÂ®&lt;/a&gt; features digitized primary historical materials, including correspondence, published articles, notebook excerpts, report drafts, and photographs selected from these collaborating institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Established in 1998, Profiles in Science is an NLM digital project that provides online access to the archival collections of more than 30 Nobel Laureates and other leading innovators in scientific and medical fields, such as genetics and genetic engineering, pediatric surgery, AIDS and infectious diseases, and biological warfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, with the launch of this new collection the National Library of Medicine begins a new effort to share with the world the richness of its vast historical collections, including those on Profiles in Science, using the social media platform Pinterest. Using Pinterest, visitors can now freely explore and share Profiles in Science collections organized around themes such as &amp;#34;Women in Science&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Life outside the lab.&amp;#34; Follow us at &lt;a href="http://www.pinterest.com/NLMProfiles/"&gt;http://www.pinterest.com/NLMProfiles/&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/ResourceMetadata/GFBBDS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Photograph of William Osler" src="/news/profiles_wm_osler.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/ResourceMetadata/GFBBDS"&gt;Sir William Osler at the American Women&amp;#39;s War Hospital, Paignton, England, 1915.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Repository: Osler Library of the History of Medicine, McGill University, William Osler Photo Collection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; is the world&amp;#39;s largest library of the health sciences and a component of the &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;.

The collection also includes nearly three dozen audiovisual productions produced by the NLM during the past six decades, as well as publications of the NLM&amp;#39;s institutional and historical &amp;#34;sister,&amp;#34; the Army Medical Museum, which is today the &lt;a href="http://www.medicalmuseum.mil/"&gt;National Museum of Health and Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. In the early 1920s, the Library of the Surgeon General&amp;#39;s Office was renamed the Army Medical Library, and it was housed with the Army Medical Museum until the 1950s when the institutions were physically separated as they are today. ÃÂ They continue to share a common goal of collecting, preserving, and providing knowledge about the past, present, and future of biomedicine and health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the variety of materials in this collectionÃ¢ÂÂincluding books, catalogs, indexes, prospectuses, policy statements, planning documents, ephemera, and technical reportsÃ¢ÂÂare dozens of historical gems, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the first printed catalogs of the &lt;a href="http://resource.nlm.nih.gov/101555658"&gt;Army Medical Museum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://resource.nlm.nih.gov/101204358"&gt;Library of the Surgeon General&amp;#39;s Office&lt;/a&gt; in 1863 and 1864, both published during the Civil War;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a 1963 &lt;a href="http://resource.nlm.nih.gov/58020620R"&gt;pamphlet&lt;/a&gt; introducing MEDLARS, the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System, which represented the birth of electronic storage and retrieval of indexed medical literature;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;all 61 volumes of the Index-Catalogue of the Library of the Surgeon-General&amp;#39;s Office, originally published from 1880 to 1961, representing one of the monuments of &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2670211/pdf/mlab-97-02-108.pdf"&gt;the Library&amp;#39;s longstanding, systematic indexing of the medical literature&lt;/a&gt;. The release of these digitized volumes follows on the NLM earlier this year releasing the Extensible Markup Language (XML) data from the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/indexcat/ichome.html"&gt;IndexCat&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; database&lt;/a&gt;, to help open this key resource in the history of medicine and science to new uses and users;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://resource.nlm.nih.gov/101241803"&gt;Dream Anatomy&lt;/a&gt;, the illustrated 2006 catalogue based on the National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s milestone Dream Anatomy exhibition;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a 1994 video entitled, &amp;#34;&lt;a href="http://resource.nlm.nih.gov/9421446"&gt;NLM and the Internet&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#34; which gives a very early look at the Internet promoting the use of Gopher files servers and Mosaic, one of the earliest web browsers first created in 1992. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about this new digital collection, please e-mail NLM Customer Service at: &lt;a href="mailto:custserv@nlm.nih.gov"&gt;custserv@nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is the world&amp;#39;s largest library of the health sciences and a component of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

    <body>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spanish Language HIV/AIDS Web Site Will Be Publicized to Latino Community as Health Resource for Loved Ones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.infosida.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;img alt="infoSIDA logo" src="/news/infosida_header.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="items"&gt;&lt;div class="columnA" style="width:45%;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) will be promoting the &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA Web site through a multi-platform media outreach effort culminating in a Twitter discussion on Valentine&amp;#39;s Day. The outreach efforts include two radio public service announcements that will air on Spanish radio stations nationwide. In addition, Fedora Braverman and Jean-Paul Rock will serve as the main NLM Spanish spokespersons, conducting interviews on &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA and other Spanish-language consumer resources from NLM. Both will be featured on &lt;em&gt;Bienvenidos a AmÃ©rica (BAA)&lt;/em&gt;, a weekly call-in radio show focused on providing immigration resources to Latinos. BAA airs weekly on Thursdays from 2-3pm EST and is on 111 Spanish stations nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to being on the air, the NLM specific segment on BAA will be streamed live on Thursday, January 30th online at bienvenidosradio.com.Â  Finally, the online resources of &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA will be shared and discussed in a Twitter &amp;#34;Tweet Up&amp;#34; on February 14, 2014, Valentine&amp;#39;s Day. NLM will be inviting all Latino-serving institutions, health and AIDS service organizations to participate and share resources for how to continue to keep loved ones healthy. Valentine&amp;#39;s Day is the holiday where we remind loved ones of how much we care about them and their well-being. This holiday serves as the perfect backdrop to raise awareness about health issues affecting our loved ones and the resources that are available to learn more about prevention and treatment. (Twitter users are invited to follow or join the conversation by using the hash tag #infoSIDA2014.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM is the world&amp;#39;s largest medical library and an integral component of the National Institutes of Health. &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA is a free online Spanish-language resource for HIV/AIDS presenting information on treatment, clinical trials, and research.Â  It is a service of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and includes authoritative content from the following HHS agencies: the National Institutes of Health, including NLM; the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA); and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This Spanish-language Web site is designed to provide HIV/AIDS-related health information resources to the Latino community in an easy-to-use format, utilizing culturally appropriate, relevant and easy-to-read language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 22% of the diagnoses of HIV infection among adults and adolescents in the United States and 6 dependent areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, the Republic of Palau, and the US Virgin Islands) from 2008 to 2011 were in Hispanics/Latinos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of new HIV infections among Latino men is almost three times that of white men (39.9 vs. 15.9 per 100,000), and the rate among Latinas is more than four times that of white women (11.8 vs. 2.6 per 100,000). Statistics like these and a need to reach vulnerable populations were a driving force in NLM recognizing the need to speak directly to Latinos on the issue of HIV/AIDS, in a culturally relevant manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rich and varied content of &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical trials information&lt;/strong&gt; on federally and privately funded studies evaluating experimental drugs and other therapies for adults and children at all stages of HIV infection;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education materials&lt;/strong&gt; about HIV/AIDS, for both patients and health care providers, including fact sheets and a glossary of HIV/AIDS-related terminology; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug information&lt;/strong&gt;, including records for FDA-approved and investigational HIV/AIDS-related drugs. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIV/AIDS health topics&lt;/strong&gt;, a comprehensive collection of links to government resources for patients and consumers;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile resources and tools&lt;/strong&gt; for iPhone, iPad and Android devices, allowing access anytime, anywhere; and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The AIDSinfo HIV/AIDS Glossary app&lt;/strong&gt;, which provides access to the same terms found in the infoSIDA Glossary of HIV/AIDS-Related Terms. The app includes English and Spanish-language definitions of more than 700 terms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA utilizes various social media channels, including:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Facebook (&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/AIDSinfo"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/AIDSinfo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Twitter (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/aidsinfo"&gt;http://twitter.com/aidsinfo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;e-news (&lt;a href="http://infosida.nih.gov/e-news"&gt;http://infosida.nih.gov/e-news&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more information, visit infosida.nih.gov.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow NLM on Twitter @nlm_news and sign up for e-mail updates on infoSIDA at: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://infosida.nih.gov/e-news"&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://infosida.nih.gov/e-news&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; /.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnB" style="width:50%;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;La NLM promueve &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA &amp;#38; la ConcientizaciÃ³n de la Salud Latina en el DÃ­a del Amor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;El sitio en espaÃ±ol HIV/SIDA serÃ¡ promovido entre la comunidad latina como un recurso para los seres queridos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La Biblioteca Nacional de Medicina (NLM) promoverÃ¡ el sitio de InternetÂ &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDAÂ  a travÃ©s de una campaÃ±a de concientizaciÃ³n multimedia que culminarÃ¡ con una discusiÃ³n en Twitter el DÃ­a del Amor. Los esfuerzos de acercamiento incluyen dos anuncios radiales de servicio pÃºblico que serÃ¡n transmitidos en estaciones radiales en espaÃ±ol en todo el paÃ­s. AdemÃ¡s hoy, Fedora Braverman y Jean-Paul Rock fungirÃ¡n como los principales portavoces en espaÃ±ol de la NLM participando en entrevistas sobreÂ &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA y otros recursos para consumidores en espaÃ±ol de la NLM. Ambos serÃ¡n presentados enÂ &lt;em&gt;Bienvenidos a AmÃ©rica&lt;/em&gt;, un programa radial semanal de llamadas en vivo que ofrece a los hispanohablantes informaciÃ³n y recursos especÃ­ficos sobre temas de inmigraciÃ³n. BAA se transmite semanalmente los jueves de 2-3PM tiempo del Este y aparece en 111 estaciones en espaÃ±ol a nivel nacional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El segmento especÃ­fico de NLM serÃ¡ adicionalmente transmitido en vivo el jueves 30 de enero enÂ &lt;a href="http://www.bienvenidosradio.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bienvenidosradio.com&lt;/a&gt;. Finalmente, los recursos en lÃ­nea deÂ &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA serÃ¡n compartidos y discutidos en un &amp;#34;Tweet Up&amp;#34; de Twitter el 14 de febrero del 2014, el DÃ­a del Amor. NLM invitarÃ¡ a todas las instituciones dedicadas a los latinos y organizaciones de salud y servicios sobre SIDA a participar y compartir recursos sobre cÃ³mo continuar manteniendo sanos a nuestros seres queridos.Â  El DÃ­a del Amor es el dÃ­a festivo en donde recordamos a nuestros seres queridos cuÃ¡nto nos importa su bienestar. Este dÃ­a feriado sirve como el contexto perfecto para elevar la conciencia sobre asuntos de salud que afectan a nuestros seres queridos y los recursos que estÃ¡n disponibles para aprender mÃ¡s acerca de la prevenciÃ³n y el tratamiento. Los usuarios de Twitter son invitados a seguir o sumarse a la conversaciÃ³n utilizando el hash tag #infoSIDA2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM es la biblioteca mÃ©dica mÃ¡s grande del mundo y un pilar de los Institutos Nacionales de Salud (NIH). &lt;em&gt;infoSIDA&lt;/em&gt; es un recurso gratuito en lÃ­nea en espaÃ±ol con informaciÃ³n sobre el tratamiento, prevenciÃ³n y resultados de investigaciones del VIH/SIDA.

El sitio Web en espaÃ±ol estÃ¡ diseÃ±ado para ofrecer recursos de informaciÃ³n sobre salud para la comunidad latina en un formato sencillo, utilizando un lenguaje culturalmente apropiado,Â  relevante y fÃ¡cil de leer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;De acuerdo con los Centros para el Control y la PrevenciÃ³n de Enfermedades (CDC), los hispanos constituyeron el Â 22% de los diagnÃ³sticos de infecciones de VIH entre adultos y adolescentes de los Estados Unidos y 6 Ã¡reas dependientes (Samoa Americana, Guam, las Islas Marianas del Norte, Puerto Rico, la RepÃºblica de PalauÂ  y las Islas VÃ­rgenes de Estados Unidos) del 2008 al 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La tasa de nuevas infecciones de VIH entre los hombres latinos es casi tres veces mÃ¡s alta que la de los hombres blancos (39.9 vs. 15.9 por 100,000 habitantes) y la tasa entre las mujeres latinas es mÃ¡s de cuatro veces mayor que la de las mujeres blancas (11.8 vs. 2.6 por 100,000). Â Tales estadÃ­sticas y la necesidad de acercarse a las poblaciones vulnerables fueron el impulso principal para que NLM reconociera la necesidad de dirigirse directamente a los latinos en el tema de VIH/SIDA, en una manera culturalmente relevante.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El enriquecedor y variado contenido deÂ &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA incluye:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;InformaciÃ³n de ensayos clÃ­nicos &lt;/strong&gt;sobre estudios financiados a nivel federal y de manera privada evaluando medicinas experimentales y otras terapias para adultos y niÃ±os en todas las etapas de la infecciÃ³n del VIH;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Materiales educativos &lt;/strong&gt;sobre el VIH/SIDA, tanto para pacientes como proveedores de salud; hojas informativas y un glosario de la terminologÃ­a relacionada con HIV/SIDA;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;InformaciÃ³n de medicamentos&lt;/strong&gt;, incluyendo registros para medicamentos aprobados por la FDA y medicinas relacionadas con investigaciones de VIH/SIDA;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temas de salud VIH/SIDA&lt;/strong&gt;, una recopilaciÃ³n integral de enlaces con los recursos del gobierno para pacientes y consumidores;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recursos mÃ³viles y herramientas &lt;/strong&gt;para iPhone, iPad y aparatos Android, que permiten el acceso a todas horas, en cualquier lugar; y&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;La aplicaciÃ³n (app) &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA Glosario VIH/SIDA &lt;/strong&gt;que ofrece acceso a los mismos tÃ©rminos encontrados en el glosario&lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA.

The 2013 CENDI Meritorious Service Award was presented at the CENDI meeting on January 9, 2014, at the National Technical Information Service in Alexandria, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cendi.gov/"&gt;CENDI&lt;/a&gt; is an interagency consortium of senior STI managers from 14 US federal agencies that represent over 97% of the federal research and development budget. The CENDI Secretariat is headquartered in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and managed by Information International Associates, Inc. CENDI&amp;#39;s Meritorious Service Award recognizes an individual(s) or team that makes &amp;#34;a noteworthy contribution to CENDI and to federal interagency cooperation through its events, publications, administration, or outreach.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CENDI recognized its deputy chair, Jerry Sheehan, for his significant contributions to its information policy programs and discussions over several years. His service includes being a CENDI alternate and then principal, deputy chair of CENDI and chair of the CENDI Policy Working Group.Â  He was a key contributor to development of white papers presented to the Obama Administration on scientific and technical information (STI) issues, and to the CENDI Grand Challenge document, &lt;em&gt;iScience to Jobs, &lt;/em&gt;in 2012. Sheehan&amp;#39;s support of CENDI has significantly increased the CENDI focus on data and promoted closer CENDI interactions with the President&amp;#39;s Office of Science and Technology Policy on open/public access issues. At a time when CENDI agencies are grappling with big data and open science, his contributions that have helped to expand CENDI&amp;#39;s attention to a range of scientific information policy issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Sheehan came to NLM in 2006 from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in Paris, where he had served as Principal Administrator and Senior Economist since 2000. He holds BS (electrical engineering) and MS (technology and policy) degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Prior to joining the OECD, Mr. Sheehan held positions as Senior Program Officer, Computer Science and Telecommunications Board, National Research Council, and in the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is the world&amp;#39;s largest library of the health sciences and a component of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

    <body>&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;The National Library of Medicine launches an &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/pickyourpoison/index.html"&gt;online adaptation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Pick Your Poison: Intoxicating Pleasures and Medical Prescriptions&lt;/em&gt;, an exhibition with education resources that features items from the National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s historical collection as well as the National Museum of American History in Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mind-altering drugs have been used throughout the history of America. While some remain socially acceptable, such as alcohol and nicotine, others, like heroin and cocaine, are now outlawed because of their toxic, and intoxicating, characteristics. These classifications have shifted at different times in history, and will continue to change. This exhibition explores some of the factors that have shaped the changing definition of some of our most potent drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pick Your Poison&lt;/em&gt; includes a &amp;#34;Digital Gallery,&amp;#34; a selection of digitized, historical texts from the History of Medicine Division&amp;#39;s diverse collections, providing viewers new avenues to explore beyond the exhibition. Education resources include a lesson plan for grades 10-12 that investigates the exhibition content; two higher education modules; and an online activity. In addition, the web feature &amp;#34;Additional Resources at NLM&amp;#34; includes a selection of published contemporary articles on the various substances featured in the exhibition, available through &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"&gt;PubMed Central&lt;/a&gt;, which provides free access to over 2.8 million life science journal articles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online adaption of &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/fromdnatobeer/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;From DNA to Beer: Harnessing Nature in Medicine and Industry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is expanded to include &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/fromdnatobeer/education/index.html"&gt;education resources.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;From DNA to Beer&lt;/em&gt; explores some of the processes, problems, and potential inherent in technologies that use life such as antibiotics and human growth hormones. The education resources delve into different aspects of the exhibition content, and include a lesson plan for grades 7-9; a higher education module; and an array of eight online activities. In addition, Additional Resources at NLM includes a selection of molecular models of the various bacteria and proteins related to the exhibition narrative, which are provided by the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/index.shtml"&gt;National Center of Biotechnology Information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (NLM) is the world&amp;#39;s largest library of the health sciences and a component of the&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;MedlinePlus Connect now supports &lt;a href="http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/index.html"&gt;ICD-10-CM&lt;/a&gt;Â  (International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, Clinical Modification) queries. Upon receiving a problem code request with an ICD-10-CM code, MedlinePlus Connect returns relevant health information from &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/"&gt;MedlinePlus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;Genetics Home Reference&lt;/a&gt;, and other reliable health resources. Note that MedlinePlus Connect will continue to deliver targeted responses to ICD-9-CM and &lt;a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org/snomed-ct/"&gt;SNOMED CT&lt;/a&gt; requests.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICD-10-CM and ICD-9-CM are classification systems used to report medical diagnoses and inpatient procedures. Although the use of ICD-10 as a required standard in the US was recently delayed by Congress, the NLM is pleased to move forward with this enhancement of MedlinePlus Connect to support user needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/connect/overview.html"&gt;MedlinePlus Connect&lt;/a&gt; is NLM&amp;#39;s service for patient portals and electronic health record (EHR) systems.Â  MedlinePlusÂ Connect makes it easy for EHRs to link to targeted information for patients from MedlinePlus, using their existing coding for diagnoses (problem codes), medications, and laboratory test results. Please see the MedlinePlus Connect documentation pages for information on using ICD-10-CM and other code systems with our &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/connect/application.html"&gt;Web application&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/connect/service.html"&gt;Web service&lt;/a&gt;.Â  Also, you can see how MedlinePlus Connect responds to ICD-10-CM codes by using the &lt;a href="http://apps2.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/services/demo.html"&gt;Web application demo page&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://apps2.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/services/servicedemo.cfm"&gt;Web service demonstration&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;National Library of Medicine (NLM)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is the world&amp;#39;s largest library of the health sciences and a component of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the US &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;National Library of Medicine (NLM)&lt;/a&gt;, a component of the National Institutes of Health, and the Wellcome Trust recently signed a memorandum of understanding to work together to make thousands of complete back issues of historically-significant biomedical journals freely available online. The terms of the MOU include a donation of ÃÂ£750,000 ($1.2 million) to the NLM that will support coordination of the three-year project to scan original materials from NLM&amp;#39;s collection at the article level, and Wellcome&amp;#39;s work to secure copyright clearances and permissions for electronic deposit from publishers. NLM will undertake conservation of the original material to ensure its preservation for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM is authorized to accept &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/donations.html"&gt;donations&lt;/a&gt; in support of its mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key journals charting the development of modern medicine over the last 150 years will be digitized in their entirety and made available on the National Institutes of Health life sciences repository &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"&gt;PubMed Central&lt;/a&gt; (PMC) and its European counterpart, &lt;a href="http://europepmc.org/"&gt;Europe PMC&lt;/a&gt;. The project builds on the &lt;a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-release-archive/WTX031289.htm"&gt;Medical Journal Backfiles Digitization Project (2004-2010)&lt;/a&gt; and will contribute substantially to the current PMC archive of over 3 million articles from medical journals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the project will concentrate on mental health journals, supporting a major archive digitization program also being undertaken by the Wellcome Trust. Journals to be digitized include &lt;em&gt;Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mental Hygiene&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychological Medicine and Mental Pathology&lt;/em&gt;. Other journals have been selected for their general relevance, such as the &lt;em&gt;Indian Medical Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;British and Foreign Medico-Chirurgical Review&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Transactions of the Epidemiology Society of London&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald A.B. Lindberg, Director of the NLM, said &amp;#34;This is a wonderful step forward in our continuing partnership with the Wellcome Trust to preserve and make freely available important biomedical literature for research, education, and learning. It is an example of a truly useful collaboration, and NLM is grateful to the Wellcome for its generosity.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon Chaplin, Head of the Wellcome Library, and Jeffrey S. Reznick, Chief of the NLM&amp;#39;s History of Medicine Division worked together to arrange the partnership in cooperation with their respective teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;We are delighted to partner with NLM to make these important archives freely available to users across the world,&amp;#34; said Chaplin. &amp;#34;It is crucial that digitized content can be found and used easily, and PubMed Central, and its European counterpart, Europe PMC, are at the top of the list for anyone searching for biomedical journals.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reznick said: &amp;#34;This partnership will benefit generations of individuals who wish to learn about biomedical history, the thousands who use PMC regularly today and the many more tomorrow who will discover and use its rich content to study the past for the benefit of the present and the future.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to images and searchable text, NLM will also create article-level citations for PubMed. Digitization is expected to start in late 2014 and to be completed by 2017. Material will be added to PMC and Europe PMC as it is digitized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://wellcomelibrary.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wellcome Library&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is one of the world&amp;#39;s leading libraries of medical history, housing 2.5 million items of extraordinary range and diversity, and a growing collection of contemporary biomedical information resources relating to consumer health, popular science, biomedical ethics and the public understanding of science. The Library is situated within &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wellcomecollection.org/wellcome-collection-is-growing.aspx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wellcome Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the free visitor destination for the incurably curious. Located at 183 Euston Road, London, Wellcome Collection explores the connections between medicine, life and art in the past, present and future.ÃÂ  Wellcome Collection is growing. Exciting new galleries and spaces and expanded Library facilities will open in autumn 2014 as part of a ÃÂ£17.5m development.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wellcome Library is part of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/"&gt;Wellcome Trust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a global charitable foundation dedicated to achieving extraordinary improvements in human and animal health. It supports the brightest minds in biomedical research and the medical humanities. The Trust&amp;#39;s breadth of support includes public engagement, education and the application of research to improve health. It is independent of both political and commercial interests.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since its founding in 1836, the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="www.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; has played a pivotal role in translating biomedical research into practice.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine (NLM) announces a funding opportunity for small projects to improve access to disaster medicine and public health information for health care professionals, first responders and others that play a role in health-related disaster preparedness, response and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM is soliciting proposals from partnerships in the U.S. that include at least one library and at least one organization that has disaster-related responsibilities, such as health departments, public safety departments, emergency management departments, pre-hospital and emergency medical services, fire/rescue, or other local, regional, or state agencies with disaster health responsibilities; hospitals; faith-based and voluntary organizations active in disaster; and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NLM encourages submission of innovative proposals that enhance mutually beneficial collaboration among libraries and disaster-related agencies. For example, projects may increase awareness of health information resources, demonstrate how libraries and librarians can assist planners and responders with disaster-related information needs, show ways in which disaster workers can educate librarians about disaster management, and/or include collaboration among partners in developing information resources that support planning and response to public health emergencies. Summaries of the previous years&amp;#39; funded projects can be viewed at &lt;a href="http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov/dimrc/disasterinfofunding.html"&gt;http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov/dimrc/disasterinfofunding.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contract awards will be offered for a minimum of $15,000 to a maximum of $30,000 each for a one-year project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deadline for proposals is Thursday, June 19, 2014 at 5 pm ET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solicitation notice can be found on FedBizOpps.gov: &lt;a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;#38;mode=form&amp;#38;id=8342e7f3a5ed717efa31cea5c8f4f879&amp;#38;tab=core&amp;#38;_cview=0"&gt;https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;#38;mode=form&amp;#38;id=8342e7f3a5ed717ef a31cea5c8f4f879&amp;#38;tab=core&amp;#38;_cview=0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information and instructions about the &amp;#34;Disaster Health Information Outreach and Collaboration Project 2014&amp;#34;, please visit &lt;a href="http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov/dimrc/2014disasteroutreachrfq.html"&gt;http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov/dimrc/2014disasteroutreachrfq.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support for librarians providing disaster information outreach to their communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since its founding in 1836, the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; has played a pivotal role in translating biomedical research into practice.

    <body>&lt;div class="caption_left"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/ResourceMetadata/TGBBJD"&gt;&lt;img alt="Portrait of Mike Gorman, ca. 1965" src="/news/gorman_portrait.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portrait of Mike Gorman, ca. 1965&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1946, an Oklahoma newspaper editor sent a young reporter to complete a story on a state psychiatric hospital. What the reporter found thereÃ¢ÂÂneglected, half-naked inmates, crowded together in filthy, dilapidated buildings, fed on rotten foodÃ¢ÂÂsent him hurrying outside to be sick. But he soon went back, taking along a photographer. And then he went to visit Oklahoma&amp;#39;s other state mental hospitals. His blistering series of newspaper articles about the institutions launched a grassroots reform movement: less than a year later, the state legislature voted huge budget increases for state hospitals, restructured the state hospital administration, and re-wrote the state&amp;#39;s commitment laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The young journalist was Mike Gorman (1913Ã¢ÂÂ1989). His work in Oklahoma earned him a Lasker Award in 1948, and changed the course of his career. Several decades later he would be called &amp;#34;the country&amp;#39;s greatest modern missionary for mental health.&amp;#34; &lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Collection/CID/TG"&gt;Mike Gorman&amp;#39;s papers&lt;/a&gt; are now online at the National Library of Medicine&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;Profiles in Science&lt;/a&gt; Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gorman&amp;#39;s Oklahoma experience taught him that newspaper exposÃÂ©s alone would not produce substantive changes. Public attention to social problems faded quickly, and entrenched social and political practices did not change without constant agitating from outside. Gorman would spend the rest of his life providing that agitation: gathering the facts about mental illness and other diseases; speaking to governors, legislators, professional groups, and the public; testifying to Congressional appropriations committees; writing books and articles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gorman came to Washington, D.C. in 1951 to be a member of President Truman&amp;#39;s Commission on the Health Needs of the Nation, and in 1953 became executive director of the National Committee Against Mental Illness, a lobbying and advocacy organization founded by philanthropist and health care activist &lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Collection/CID/TL"&gt;Mary Lasker&lt;/a&gt;. In that post, he became perhaps America&amp;#39;s best known lobbyist and publicist in the crusade for psychiatric hospital reform and the community mental health center movement. Gorman played a key role in shaping many of the social programs of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, including the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act of 1963. During the 1970s and 1980s he also directed two other advocacy groups, Citizens for the Treatment of High Blood Pressure, which helped coordinate a highly successful national hypertension education and screening program, and the National Initiative for Glaucoma Control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presentation features correspondence, photographs, speeches and addresses given by Gorman, speeches he wrote for members of Congress and several U.S. Presidents, along with published articles and reports from the Gorman collection. Visitors to the site can view, for example, his first series of articles for the Daily Oklahoman, drafts of speeches Gorman wrote for Presidents Truman and Kennedy, and the public service announcements issued by the Citizens for the Treatment of High Blood Pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Established in 1998, Profiles in Science is an NLM digital project that provides online access to the archival collections of more than 30 Nobel Laureates and other leading innovators in scientific and medical fields, such as genetics and genetic engineering, pediatric surgery, AIDS and infectious diseases, and biological warfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since its founding in 1836, the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; has played a pivotal role in translating biomedical research into practice.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine is pleased to announce that Georgia Regents University (GRU) will serve as the host organization for the NLM-sponsored biomedical informatics course. The NLM Biomedical Informatics Course, now entering its 22nd year, offers participants a week-long immersive experience in biomedical informatics taught by experts in the field. The course was previously held at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, MA, with Cathy Norton, MLS, as the MBL principal investigator. NLM plans to take the skills shaped over the past two decades at MBL to its new colleagues at GRU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first course organized at Georgia Regents University will be held September 14-20, 2014, and subsequently each fall and spring through 2018. The course will be held at a conference center in Young Harris, GA, frequently used by Georgia Regents University, at no cost to participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Application to the course is open to all, but space is limited. Preference will be given to American applicants who demonstrate, through a brief application letter, that they have the significant need for an understanding of the informatics solutions that are available to address their biomedical research, practice and education challenges and that, through their official position, they are significant Ã¢ÂÂchange agentsÃ¢ÂÂ who can influence the adoption of best practices in their own environment and expand the influence of the course to others through teaching or by example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Application information can be found at: &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;#39;Calibri&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;sans-serif&amp;#39;;font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gru.edu/library/greenblatt/services/biomedical-informatics-fall-2014.php "&gt;&lt;span style="color: #0000ff;"&gt;http://www.gru.edu/library/greenblatt/services/biomedical-informatics-fall-2014.php&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course, co-directed by James J. Cimino, MD, Chief, Laboratory for Informatics Development at the National Library of Medicine and the NIH Clinical Center, and NLM Director Donald Lindberg, MD, will guide participants through topics including biomedical informatics methods, clinical informatics, big data and imaging, genomics, consumer health informatics, mathematical modeling, and telemedicine and telehealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The co-principal investigators from GRU are Brenda L.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Professor, Scientist and Advisor to NIH Director Will Discuss &amp;#34;The BRAIN Initiative: Connecting the Dots&amp;#34;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_left"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dr. Terrence Sejnowski" src="/news/terry_sejnowski.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Terrence Sejnowski&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terrence Sejnowski, PhD, will give the 2014 Joseph Leiter NLM/Medical Library Association (MLA) Lecture on Thursday, June 12, 2014, at 1:00 pm (ET) in the Lister Hill Center Auditorium at the National Library of Medicine (Building 38A, first floor), on the campus of the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. The lecture will also be recorded and broadcast live on the Web at: &lt;a href="http://videocast.nih.gov"&gt;http://videocast.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sejnowski is a pioneer in computational neuroscience and his goal is to understand the principles that link brain to behavior. He is interested in the hippocampus, believed to play a major role in learning and memory; and the cerebral cortex, which holds our knowledge of the world and how to interact with it. His laboratory uses both experimental and modeling techniques to study the biophysical properties of synapses and neurons and the population dynamics of large networks of neurons. New computational models and new analytical tools have been developed to understand how the brain represents the world and how new representations are formed through learning algorithms for changing the synaptic strengths of connections between neurons. By studying how the resulting computer simulations can perform operations that resemble the activities of the hippocampus, Dr. Sejnowski hopes to gain new knowledge of how the human brain is capable of learning and storing memories. This knowledge ultimately may provide medical specialists with critical clues to combating Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease and other disorders that rob people of the critical ability to remember faces, names, places and events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terrence Sejnowski is an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and holds the Francis Crick Chair at The Salk Institute for Biological Studies. He is also a professor of biology at the University of California, San Diego, where he is co-director of the Institute for Neural Computation and co-director of the Temporal Dynamics of Learning Center. He has published over 400 scientific papers and 12 books, including &lt;em&gt;The Computational Brain&lt;/em&gt;, with Patricia Churchland. He is a member of the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering, one of only 13 living persons to be a member of all 3 national academies. Dr. Sejnowski was instrumental in shaping the &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/science/brain/index.htm"&gt;BRAIN Initiative&lt;/a&gt; that was announced from the White House on April 2, 2013, and serves on the Advisory Committee to the Director of NIH for the BRAIN Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Joseph Leiter NLM/MLA Lecture was established in 1983 to stimulate intellectual liaison between the MLA and the NLM. Leiter was a major contributor in cancer research at the National Cancer Institute and a leader at NLM as a champion of medical librarians and an informatics pioneer. He served as NLM Associate Director for Library Operations from 1965 to 1983.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directions to NLM and details about visiting NLM and the NIH campus are available at: &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/psd/ref/guide/rrdirect.html"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/psd/ref/guide/rrdirect.html&lt;/a&gt;. Visitors enter the NIH campus through the NIH Gateway Center, the central location for registering and orienting visitors, and must provide one (1) form of identification (a government-issued photo IDÃ¢ÂÂdriver&amp;#39;s license, passport, green card, etc.). The NIH Gateway Center is accessible from NIH Gateway Drive and is near the exit of the Metro system Medical Center stop (Red Line). All visitors are encouraged to use Metro or other public transportation, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since its founding in 1836, the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; has played a pivotal role in translating biomedical research into practice.

They are now automatically optimized for display across all devicesÃ¢ÂÂdesktop computers, tablets, and smartphones. Visitors to the AIDS&lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt;SIDA Web sites will now be able to access all of the Web site content on any device they are using. AIDS&lt;em&gt;info&lt;/em&gt; offersÃÂ access to the latest, federally approved HIV/AIDS medical practice guidelines, HIV treatment and prevention clinical trials, and other research information for health care providers, researchers, people affected by HIV/AIDS, and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We decided to create a responsive design Web siteÃ¢ÂÂa site that automatically adjusts to any deviceÃ¢ÂÂbecause of a shift in the ways that people are accessing the Internet. Between 2010 and 2014, mobile traffic to the AIDSinfo Web site increased tenfold, and almost 90% of health care providers surveyed on the AIDSinfo Web site have Internet access at the point of care (i.e., while caring for patients), and of those, more than two thirds use a mobile device when seeing patients. With this redesign, health care providers, researchers, people with HIV/AIDS, their family and friends, and anyone who visits the Web site will now be able to access the &lt;a href="http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines"&gt;HIV/AIDS medical practice guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/drugs"&gt;drug database&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/fact-sheets"&gt;fact sheets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/clinical-trials"&gt;clinical trials search&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/glossary"&gt;HIV/AIDS glossary&lt;/a&gt;, and all of the other Web site features in an easy-to-navigate format no matter what device they are using.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have saved the mobile site URLs (&lt;a href="http://m.aidsinfo.nih.gov/"&gt;http://m.aidsinfo.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://m.infosida.nih.gov/"&gt;http://m.infosida.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt;) as a Bookmark or Favorite on your tablet or smartphone, you will be automatically forwarded to the responsive design Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please send your questions or feedback about the responsive design Web site to: &lt;a href="mailto:ContactUs@aidsinfo.nih.gov"&gt;ContactUs@aidsinfo.nih.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since its founding in 1836, the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; has played a pivotal role in translating biomedical research into practice.

Harless, PhD, then director of NLMÃ¢ÂÂs TIME Project, interacts with the clinical simulation titled, Ã¢ÂÂThe Case of Frank Hall,Ã¢ÂÂ through voice-recognition technology. The simulation received an award in the category of Best Educational Achievement at an awards ceremony at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;William G. Harless, President and CEO of Interactive Drama Inc. and former National Library of Medicine employee and contractor, passed away this past May. Dr. HarlessÃ¢ÂÂs contributions to the NLM were many, including the creation of the first voice-activated interactive video patient simulation model in the mid-1980s. As Director of NLMÃ¢ÂÂs Technological Innovations in Medical Education (TIME) Project, he received the 1986 NLM Regents Award for Scholarship or Technical Achievement and an award in the category of Best Educational Achievement at the University of NebraskaÃ¢ÂÂboth for the development of his model which combined voice recognition, interactive video, and computer technologies. With his passing, NLM remembers a colleague and a friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Harless held a PhD degree in psychology and learning theory. He also had held faculty positions at five major universities and the Union for Experimenting Colleges and Universities, where accredited doctorate degrees are awarded from a multidisciplinary, experientially based curriculum. He developed the first natural language computer patient simulation model at the University of Illinois School of Medicine in Chicago in the early 1960s. Dr. Harless published over 50 articles on natural language interactive simulation as a learning strategy and was a recognized expert in the field. In 1991, he was awarded a patent for his voice-controlled video simulation model. He was awarded a second patent in 1996 for his dynamic prompting system. In 2005, a third patent was awarded on a method of distributing his model over a computer network, and in 2010 he was awarded a patent for his method for analyzing natural language text to yield a meaningful response to a free-speech inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of his legacy lives on in the &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/vcenter.html"&gt;NLM Visitor Center&lt;/a&gt; (on the first floor of NIH Building 38A, the Lister Hill Center), where the Ã¢ÂÂDialogues in ScienceÃ¢ÂÂ kiosk, featuring content and technology he created, allows guests to conduct virtual interviews with leading figures in science and technology, including current NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins, NLM Director Dr. Donald A.B. Lindberg, geneticist Dr. Joshua Lederberg, winner of the 1958 Nobel Prize for his discovery of how bacteria transfer genes, former US Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop and astronaut John Glenn who, following a career in the US Senate, returned to space to participate in experiments aboard the Space Shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A memorial service for Bill Harless will be held by his family at 7:00 PM, Sunday, June 8, at the Cedar Lane Unitarian Universalist Church, 9601 Cedar Lane, Bethesda, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of us at the NLM join in mourning the loss of such a remarkable scientist, innovative leader, and cherished colleague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since its founding in 1836, the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; has played a pivotal role in translating biomedical research into practice.
