&lt;h2&gt;Terry Ahmed, Head of Reference and Web Services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please describe your educational and/or professional background.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I wanted to be a restaurant owner/manager, so I got a BS in Food Systems Management from Buffalo State College while I also worked at the library there. But, as time went on, I realized I really enjoyed the library work, and then went on to get an MLS from SUNY Buffalo. Like many undergrads, this may look like a drastic change in career path, but it&amp;#8217;s what I wanted to do. I started at NLM as a contractor for the customer services operation, and now I&amp;#8217;m the Head of Reference and Web Services.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you enjoy most about your job at NLM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I like being a part of the section that oversees MedlinePlus, the main Website and our customer service operation. It&amp;#8217;s gratifying to know that we are serving the public by creating and managing content that will provide them with needed health information. It&amp;#8217;s also very satisfying to know that we can help our users navigate through our vast Website and also assist them with using our premier products including PubMed, MedlinePlus, NIHSeniorHealth, many others.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your typical work day like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;It starts with responding to tons of email from staff, colleagues and senior management. Much of my job is management, administration, policy development and interpretation. I might be reviewing a draft document or presentation created by my staff or I could be asked to provide advice on a document from a colleague or by management. Or, I could be working on a project plan for some new system we hope to implement. I might be having a brainstorming session with staff about promoting services of the library or I could also be listening to concerns from one of our users in the Reading Room. &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What skills have been most useful to you in your job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;People skills serve me best. I like talking with staff and helping them find solutions to problems, or listening to their ideas about how to proceed on a new project. I think my experience from working in special, academic and public libraries have all been helpful to me in my positions here.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like about work life at NLM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I like the versatility of the work. The projects that come to me are varied. I also manage a wonderful group of people who are full of ideas and who care about the NLM mission and enjoy their work. Being a part of an organization with an important mission is a fantastic experience for me. &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;David Anderson, Systems Librarian&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please describe your educational and/or professional background.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I have an MLS from University of Maryland and a BA in History from William and Mary. I have worked previously in a variety of roles in academic libraries including reference, managing digital collections and technical services. I am currently a Systems Librarian in the Technical Services Division at NLM.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you enjoy most about your job at NLM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I get to work with massive amounts of data and solve problems I would not encounter anywhere else. The medical community and the world at large really value our data, and I take pride in the fact that we are a major source for the world&amp;#8217;s medical information.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your typical work day like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Every day is different. I resolve problems with systems and software. I make batch data changes. Sometimes I look at code. I do testing for upgrades. I make sure technology works.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What skills have been most useful to you in your job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Problem solving skills, general technology skills and communication skills help me the most. We face some unique problems as a large national library with a number of novel systems, so it helps to be able to think creatively about solutions.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like about work life at NLM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Everyone is good at their jobs and willing to help. I am constantly learning something new. I also like that telework is an option.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;div class="columnB" style="width:75%;"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dianna Adams, Head, Desktop Services Section&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please describe your educational and/or professional background.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I have a Master&amp;#8217;s Degree in Computer Systems Management, a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Systems Management, and an Executive Chief Information Officer (CIO) Certificate. I began my career as an active-duty soldier in the United States Army working as a circuit systems technical controller. After serving 20 years in the United States Army, I retired from active duty and started my civilian career as a federal contractor, working as an IT Operations Manager. &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you enjoy most about your job at NLM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I truly enjoy working with my team and interacting with the customers. We are a team of professionals who work hard to get the job done. I like that no two days are ever the same. Because IT is ever-changing, there is always something new to learn. As a young soldier in the military, I said I wanted to learn something new every day of my life. So far, I have been able to continue doing this. &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your typical work day like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I start each day in a meeting with my Team Leads. We discuss projects, high priority issues. Then we work with the relevant teams to make sure things go smoothly. &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What skills have been most useful to you in your job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;My soft skills such as management, customer service, time management, listening, and communication have helped me a lot. Because our customers should receive no less than the best service, it is important that I communicate often and effectively with my team and our customers.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like about work life at NLM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Working at NLM inspires me and contributes to my overall growth. I love the diversity and synergy of the NLM community, which promotes diverse experiences. My supervisor and team have helped me to develop and grow as a leader. I have the best team -- they are very smart, supportive people. I enjoy the team building activities that we have. We always find reasons to have a potluck!&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;div class="columnB" style="width:75%;"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preeti Gokal Kochar, Indexer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please describe your educational and/or professional background.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;After completing my Bachelor&amp;#8217;s in Life Sciences in India, I came to South Carolina for my graduate studies. I worked on gene transcription for my thesis and earned a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology/Biochemistry. After a couple years of post-doctoral research, I taught various biological subjects like genetics and anatomy &amp;amp; physiology to undergraduate students. For the last ten years I&amp;#8217;ve been indexing &amp;#8211; first at a private company and for the last 7 years I&amp;#8217;ve been at NLM, indexing for MEDLINE.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you enjoy most about your job at NLM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I enjoy working with the Index Section staff &amp;#8211; a group of highly educated professionals. We perform the complex task of analyzing articles in biomedical journals and creating MEDLINE citations by assigning controlled vocabulary terms (MeSH) and adding gene links, publication types, etc. We are a culturally diverse group and have the best potlucks!&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your typical work day like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Like most staff in the Index Section, I am allowed to telework. I work from home 3 days a week! My time is split between basic duties like indexing, training &amp;amp; revising contract indexers and special projects like the Medical Text Indexer (MTI).&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What skills have been most useful to you in your job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Sound biomedical knowledge and ability to work with different people are crucial. It also helps to have basic computer skills and be a life-long learner.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like about work life at NLM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I like being part of the world&amp;#8217;s largest medical library and contributing in a small way to the vast biomedical information resources NLM provides. I also like being part of the NIH and attending seminars and symposia at the different Institutes.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

 &lt;div class="columnB" style="width:75%;"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kate Masterton, Associate Fellow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;dl&gt; 
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could you describe for us your educational and/or professional background?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;

   &lt;dd&gt;I received a B.A. from Hope College in Michigan and a MLIS with a Certificate in Healthcare Informatics from Drexel University in Pennsylvania. I have previous experience working and volunteering in academic, state, and public libraries.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you enjoy most about your job at NLM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Being an Associate Fellow at NLM affords me the opportunity to continuously learn and explore with some of the leading experts in medical librarianship. I approach each day with keen curiosity and excitement.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your typical work day like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Currently, the Associates are in the curriculum phase of our program year. This means that we spend a great deal of time speaking with staff from each library division to learn about the products and services provided by NLM in the present, as well as what is anticipated for the future. We are given ample time to ask questions and generate additional discussions of professional interest. I also spend part of my day working on two projects, one with the Lister Hill Center and another with the National Center for Biotechnology Information. When the curriculum ends in February, I will select larger spring projects to lead for the remainder of my Fellowship year.  &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What skills have been most useful to you in your job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;While obtaining my MS of Library and Information Science from Drexel, I took a lot of the coursework for the MS of Information Systems. Because so many NLM initiatives hinge upon the success of the technology involved, my pre-existing knowledge of information systems development and management aids my understanding of the products and services NLM provides. &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like about work life at NLM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;It is extremely rewarding to be able to contribute to the overall mission of NIH. In addition, I am inspired by the NLM staff. While each individual brings a unique set of skills and knowledge to the organization, all are united by a constant dedication to provide biomedical information to the world and ensure that this knowledge will be available for future generations. &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you enjoy doing outside of work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Outside of work I enjoy crocheting, listening to opera, homebrewing, exercising, and hiking.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Clinical Advisory: Randomized, Multi-Center, Phase III Study of Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation Comparing Regimen Intensity in Patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (BMT CTN 0901)</title>
    <created>2014-05-14</created>
    <changed>2014-05-15</changed>
    <permanence>Permanent: Unchanging Content</permanence>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health's (NIH) National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has suspended enrollment for the clinical study BMT CTN 0901 conducted by the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) after preliminary data appeared to show benefit for one approach to the intensity of conditioning for allogeneic stem cell transplantations in patients eligible for the study.&lt;/p&gt;

 
&lt;p&gt;This trial, sponsored by the NHLBI and the NIH's National Cancer Institute (NCI), compares outcomes following myeloablative (high-intensity) conditioning versus reduced-intensity conditioning in preparation for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML); participants enrolled in this study must have been able to tolerate a high-intensity conditioning regimen.  The specific patient inclusion and exclusion requirements are listed on the following page.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;In this study, patients were randomized to either a myeloablative or a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen, with the choice of regimen, from the options below, left to the transplant center.&lt;/p&gt;
  
&lt;p&gt;The 3 myeloablative (high-intensity) regimens allowed in this study were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Busulfan at high doses (16 mg/kg PO or 12.8 mg/kg IV) and Fludarabine (120-180 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Busulfan at high doses (16 mg/kg PO or 12.8 mg/kg IV) and Cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and Total Body Irradiation (1200-1420 cGy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2 reduced-intensity conditioning regimens allowed in this study were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fludarabine (120-180 mg/m2) and Busulfan at low doses (&amp;#8804; 8 mg/kg PO or 6.4 mg/kg IV) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fludarabine (120-180 mg/m2) and Melphalan (&amp;#8804; 150 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graft sources included bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells, but umbilical cord blood was not permitted.  The use of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) was permitted, though not required, at the dose and schedule of ATG administration per institutional standards.&lt;/p&gt;
   
&lt;p&gt;A preliminary data review by the NHLBI Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) appears to show that a sufficient number of patients have been enrolled to potentially answer the study objectives.  Preliminary review of study data appears to suggest a benefit of the myeloablative conditioning regimens used in this study over the reduced-intensity conditioning regimens used in this study for patients who met the study's eligibility criteria. &lt;/p&gt;

 
&lt;p&gt;The NHLBI accepted the recommendation of the DSMB, which is an independent advisory group of experts in stem cells therapy, biostatistics, medical ethics, and clinical trial design. The DSMB has been monitoring the study since it began in May 2011. The study enrolled 272 of an originally planned 356 participants at 32 transplant centers before enrollment of new study participants was permanently closed on April 18, 2014.  The DSMB recommended that all patients currently enrolled in the study continue to receive their protocol-directed therapy and evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This medical advisory applies only to patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia who meet the same criteria used in the study. Inclusion criteria for study participants were:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Age 18 to 65 years old.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diagnosis of MDS or AML with fewer than 5 percent myeloblasts in the bone marrow and no leukemic myeloblasts in the peripheral blood on morphologic analysis performed within 30 days of the conditioning regimen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For those receiving treatment of their MDS or AML prior to transplantation: a) Interval between the start of the most recent cycle of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy and enrollment must be at least 30 days; b) Interval between completing treatment with a hypomethylating agent or other non-cytotoxic chemotherapy and enrollment must be at least 10 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must have a related donor who is a 7/8 or 8/8 match at HLA-A, -B, -C (serologic typing or higher resolution) and -DRB1 (at high resolution using DNA-based typing), or an unrelated donor who is a 7/8 or 8/8 match at HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 at high resolution using DNA-based typing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant-Specific Comorbidity Index Score (HCT-CI) less than or equal to 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organ function: a) Cardiac function: Ejection fraction greater than or equal to 40 percent, b) Hepatic function: total bilirubin less than or equal to 2 times the upper limit of normal and ALT and AST less than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal, c) Pulmonary function: DLCO percent (corrected for hemoglobin) greater than or equal to 40 percent and FEV1 greater than or equal to 50.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 50mL/min based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Exclusion criteria for study participants were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior allograft or prior autograft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symptomatic coronary artery disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leukemia involvement in the central nervous system (CNS) within 4 weeks of enrollment for patients with a history of prior CNS leukemia involvement (i.e., leukemic blasts previously detected in the cerebral spinal fluid).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Karnofsky Performance Score less than 70.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patients receiving supplemental oxygen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planned use of donor lymphocyte infusion therapy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patients with uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infections (undergoing appropriate treatment and with progression of clinical symptoms).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patients seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patients with prior malignancies, except resected basal cell carcinoma or treated cervical carcinoma in situ. Cancer treated with curative intent greater than 5 years previously allowed. Cancer treated with curative intent less than 5 years previously will not be allowed unless approved by the Protocol Officer or one of the Protocol Chairs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fertile men and women unwilling to use contraceptive techniques during and for 12 months following treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial's main objective was to compare survival rates between the two intensities of conditioning 18 months after the transplant procedure.  Full results from the study will be available at a later date. While the study is no longer enrolling, participants who already have undergone a conditioning procedure will continue to be followed for the full 18 months, as specified in the study. 
There are about 13,000 new cases of MDS and 18,860 new cases of AML each year in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society, although not all persons with these diseases would be eligible for the treatments in this study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NLM began offering clinical alert notices online in January 1991. Clinical alerts are provided to expedite the release of findings from the NIH-funded clinical trials where such release could significantly affect morbidity and mortality. Links to clinical alerts are provided below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Division of Payment Management.&lt;/strong&gt; Payments for grants awarded by NIH are made through the Division of Payment Management with the exception of awards to individuals, foreign organizations, and agencies of the Federal Government, which are paid by the NIH Office of Financial Management. Applicant organizations are assigned a 12-digit Entity Identification Number for payment and accounting purposes. That number is an expansion of the 9-digit Employer Identification Number assigned to an organization by the Internal Revenue Service.&amp;#160; &lt;a href="http://www.dpm.psc.gov/"&gt;http://www.dpm.psc.gov/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Data Element Catalog identifies data element names required for capture in Electronic Health Record (EHR) technology certified under the 2014 Edition of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) Standards and Certification Criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complete Data Element Catalog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Complete Data Element Catalog is a comprehensive list of data elements from the entire Stage 2 EHR Incentive Program Clinical Quality Measure set. For each Clinical Quality Measure (CQM) the following are listed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;care setting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;measure title&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;component data element names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;categories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vocabularies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) requires reporting the supplemental data elements for each measure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tax ID Number (TIN)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National Provider ID (NPI) (Eligible Professional measures only)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CMS Certification Number (CCN) (Eligible Hospital measures only)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medicare Health Insurance Claim (HIC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date of Birth (DOB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Race&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethnicity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Payer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compressed View&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Data Element Catalog: Compressed View is a list of unique CQM data elements, created to facilitate an easier &amp;#8220;global&amp;#8221; view of the catalog. For each data element the following are listed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;category&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vocabulary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supplemental status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;respective NQF number or name &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Usage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the Clinical Quality Measures are finalized by CMS,&amp;#160;the elements listed herein will be accompanied by unique value sets, which will provide explicit guidance regarding the expected values, categories and vocabularies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback and Suggestions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We welcome any questions, comments or suggestions that would improve the quality, accuracy and usability of the catalog.&lt;br&gt;Please send feedback or questions to the &lt;a href="http://jira.oncprojectracking.org/browse/CQM"&gt;ONC Project Tracking System - CQM Issue Tracker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please see the &lt;a href="http://oncprojectracking.org/"&gt;ONC Project Tracking System - Home Page&lt;/a&gt; for help with using this feedback system.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;div class="description medium"&gt;Per Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), VSAC is the official repository for Value Sets that support 2014 Meaningful Use Clinical Quality Measures (CQMs). VSAC will also host other value sets such as Routes of Administration and Patient Assessment Instruments in the near future. The VSAC provides Certified EHR implementers the ability to search for and retrieve these value sets both through a GUI interface as well as APIs that can be implemented into an automated system. VSAC will also provide authoring tools for value set authors that will leverage NLM expertise in synonymy (UMLS) as well as provide instant code/descriptor validation.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;RxNorm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="description medium"&gt;2014 EHR certification criteria designate RxNorm as the vocabulary for medications. RxNorm, a standardized nomenclature for clinical drugs and drug delivery devices, is produced by the National Library of Medicine (NLM). RxNorm provides normalized names for clinical drugs and links its names to many of the drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug interaction software, including those of First Databank, Micromedex, MediSpan, Gold Standard, and Multum. By providing links between these vocabularies, RxNorm can mediate messages between systems not using the same software and vocabulary.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="description medium"&gt;The Current Prescribable Content (CPC) subset of RxNorm provides content from RxNorm for satisfying this requirement. Each monthly release of the CPC subset contains the names and codes for those drugs that the NLM believes to be currently available on the US market. This includes both National Drug Codes (NDCs) and RxNorm Concept Unique Identifiers (RxCUIs). The CPC is limited to content produced or derived by the NLM, eliminating intellectual property considerations associated with using the full monthly RxNorm dataset. &lt;br&gt;For information on discontinued/obsolete drugs, or to map RxNorm codes to and from codes from other drug information sources, a user will need to consult the full RxNorm dataset.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;LOINC Top 300+ Lab Orders&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class="description medium"&gt;This is a collection of the top 300+ most common universal laboratory order codes for use by developers of order entry systems that deliver them in HL7 messages to laboratories, where they could be understood and fulfilled. This value set is designed to cover greater than 95% of the test ordering volume in the US, and was developed with both empirical and consensus-driven approaches. This list is referenced by the HITSP C80 Clinical Document and Messaging Terminology Construct in Table 2-96 "Laboratory Order Value Set" where it states that it "should be considered a minimum &amp;#8220;starter&amp;#8221; set" and "does not attempt to include all possible LOINC codes" or all possible lab orders.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;LOINC Top 2000+ Lab Observations and Mapper's Guide&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class="description medium"&gt;This is an empirically-based list of the most common LOINC result codes for laboratories, practices, researchers, and others who wish to map their laboratory test codes to universal LOINC codes. Knowing that relatively few codes account for much of the result volume, we think that the Top 2000+ list will be an excellent starter set. This list contains 2017 most commonly reported LOINC codes that represent about 98% of the test volume carried by three large organizations that mapped all of their laboratory tests to LOINC codes. To jump start your mapping effort, check out the Mapper's Guide to the Top 2000+ Lab Tests. It contains a wealth of advice and guidance about which codes to choose for a given purpose.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;LOINC Panels and Forms file&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class="description medium"&gt;This file is an export of a key subset of the Panels and Forms represented in LOINC. The entire package of this key subset is currently available at &lt;a href="http://loinc.org/downloads/accessory-files" target="_blank"&gt;http://loinc.org/downloads/accessory-files&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to separate packages for Laboratory panels, Clinical panels, Consumer Health panels, HEDIS panels, the HL7 Clinical Genetics panels, Newborn Screening panels, PhenX panels, US Government panels (including the CMS survey instruments MDSv2, MDSv3, OASIS, and CARE), and Other Survey Instruments. The hierarchical structure is represented in the file by the PARENT_ID, ID and SEQUENCE fields. The root, or top level, records in the file are those records where the PARENT_ID = ID. The records are in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (compressed as a zip file) with separate worksheets (tabs) for the form structure, LOINC code details, and answer lists.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The History of Medicine Reading Room is open to the public, free of charge, Monday-Friday, 8:30-5:00 (EST), except on Federal holidays. Material is retrieved from the stacks on the hour from 9 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrons are asked to register at the reference counter and sign the visitor's book. Papers and notebooks are permitted in the Reading Room. Coats and bags are stored in secure lockers in the cloakroom. We will supply pencils for note-taking, if needed, since pens and highlighters may not be used with collection material.

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;NLM History of Medicine Volunteer Program&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/hmd/" title="History of Medicine Division Home Page"&gt;National Library of Medicine’s History of Medicine Division&lt;/a&gt; welcomes applications for its volunteer program, from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;undergraduate students in any discipline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;current graduate students in library science or information studies, archival studies, cultural studies, film studies, history of medicine and science, museum studies, preservation, public heath, or related programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;other qualified individuals of any age and background who would wish to offer their experiences and skills
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HMD volunteer program offers practical, hands-on and results-oriented experience in the largest medical library in the world with one of the finest history of medicine collections.  Individuals who participate in this program can expect an invaluable introduction to a unique part of the US Department of Health and Human Services, which in 2013 was rated in the top-20 in &lt;a href="http://www.bestplacestowork.org/BPTW/rankings/overall/large" title="The Best Places to Work in the Federal Government"&gt;The Best Places to Work in the Federal Government&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the direct supervision of permanent library staff, selected volunteers will undertake projects, or a combination of projects based on their interests, skills, and the needs of the History of Medicine Division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The History of Medicine Division offers volunteer opportunities in the following administrative and programmatic areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archival Arrangement and Description&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cataloging and Bibliography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collection Development and Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Mining and Visualization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digitization Research and Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exhibitions, Public Programs, and Outreach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historical Research and Writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web Development, Social Media, and Publicity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Eligibility:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volunteer services may be accepted from individuals who are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donating their services as members of volunteer or charitable organizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offering their services on their own time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Receiving fellowship or stipend support from outside organizations with whom they have non-employment relationships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employees of outside organizations on sabbaticals or leaves of absences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Federal employee volunteering services unrelated to their official duties and responsibilities, outside of their normal work hours&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, due to regulations, volunteer services may &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be accepted from individuals who are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commissioned Officers in the U.S. Public Health Service or members of other uniformed services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paid employees of outside organizations who are not on sabbaticals or leaves of absence, unless their volunteer service is on their own time&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Requirements:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All volunteers must carry their own health insurance and submit proof of coverage. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permanent residents must be cleared by the Division of International Services (DIS), Office of Research Services (ORS), NIH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Special requirements for Non-immigrant Foreign Nationals&lt;/span&gt;:  Must have appropriate visas that support activities at NIH and must have, at a minimum, a master’s degree or equivalent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We encourage applicants of all ages, however, applicants must be at least 16 years old.  Applicants under 18 years of age must meet Federal government employment standards for minors or provide a State issued work permit.  The agreement of a parent or guardian is also required before the volunteer services of minors can be accepted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compensation: Unpaid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning credit: Students who are interested in obtaining course credit for volunteering should arrange accordingly with their academic advisors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time commitment: Depending on needs of the HMD programmatic area, commensurate with candidate availability, and always within normal business hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NLM/HMD is an Official Certifying Organization for the &lt;a href="http://www.presidentialserviceawards.gov/"&gt;
President's Volunteer Service Awards&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative of the &lt;a href="http://www.cns.gov"&gt;Corporation for National and Community Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interested individuals should send the following materials via email to the &lt;a href="mailto:akj@mail.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;Office of the Chief&lt;/a&gt;, NLM History of Medicine Division:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a cover letter detailing:
     &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;interests, skills, and expertise and the NLM/HMD programmatic area(s) of specific interest, including how the individual’s background would benefit the programmatic area(s) of specific interest&lt;/li&gt; 
     &lt;li&gt;availability of the volunteer, including how many hours per week could be offered, and for what duration (eg. 3 months, 6 months, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;current resume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contact details of three professional references&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;The NLM highly encourages applicants from diverse backgrounds to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note that NLM/HMD volunteer opportunities do not result in employment with the NLM&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

Welcome to the History of Medicine Finding Aids Consortium, a discovery tool providing keyword search services across a union catalog of descriptions of primary source materials found in special collections and archives throughout the U.S. The Consortium leads you to the rich information found in historical documents, personal papers, business records, and more. Finding aids provide contextual information about these collections along with detailed inventories to help researchers locate relevant materials.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We currently index over 3,600 finding aids from 35 institutions that collect broadly in the area of the history of medicine and its allied sciences and more general special collections and archives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links to finding aids direct users to web sites hosted by the participating institutions. All questions regarding the collection contents should be directed to the owning institution.

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
&lt;a id="photocopies" name="photocopies"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How to get photocopies of NLM historical material&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-service photocopying of historical material is not permitted. For onsite patrons, History of Medicine staff will do limited photocopying for a fee of 20¢ per page, depending on the condition of the material. Patrons may pick up completed orders at the History of Medicine Reading Room or have them mailed free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off site requests for photocopies of journal articles require an interlibrary loan request. See &lt;a href="#ill"&gt;How Do I Borrow?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
&lt;a id="pictures" name="pictures"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How to get copies of pictures from books, journals, manuscripts, etc., in NLM historical collections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Library has arrangements in place with an approved photographer, who, at the discretion of the History of Medicine Conservation Librarian, performs onsite photography of material from historical collections. The photographer visits History of Medicine at least once a month. Patrons make billing and shipping arrangements directly with the photographer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before requesting photographic services, read the following forms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="disc"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="forms/photographic_instructions.pdf"&gt;Photographic Services: Information and Instructions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="forms/photographic_pricelist.pdf"&gt;Photographic Services: Price List&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="forms/photographic_request.pdf"&gt;Photographic Services: Request Form&lt;/a&gt;: Patrons must complete this form, sign, and return via mail or in person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information &lt;a href="#ask"&gt;Ask a Reference Librarian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href="../../collections/archives/ammp/index.html#photorepro"&gt;Photographic reproductions&lt;/a&gt; at the Archives and Modern Manuscripts Program page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;a href="copyright"&gt;Historical Collections Copyright Information&lt;/a&gt; applies to all photographic reproduction requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
&lt;a id="films" name="films"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How to get copies of NLM historical pictures and films&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For prints and photographs, search the &lt;a href="/hmd/ihm/index"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Images from the History of Medicine (IHM)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; database and see &lt;strong&gt;Order Images&lt;/strong&gt; on the IHM homepage. Also see &lt;a href="../../collections/photos/index"&gt;Prints and Photographs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To purchase copies of films and videos, see &lt;a href="../../collections/films/index.html#a4"&gt;How to Access and Use Films and Videos&lt;/a&gt;. See also &lt;a href="../../collections/films/index"&gt;Films and Videos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
&lt;a id="microfilm" name="microfilm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How to purchase microfilm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some books and manuscripts in NLM historical collections have been microfilmed and are available for purchase. The item's LocatorPlus record indicates if that item has been microfilmed. For information about purchasing microfilm, see the &lt;a href="/pubs/factsheets/microflm"&gt;Microfilm Sales Program Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="#ask"&gt;Ask a Reference Librarian Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <permanence>Permanent: Dynamic Content</permanence>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998, NLM announced a new, three-phased NGI research program to develop innovative medical projects that demonstrate the application and use of NGI capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality of service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medical data privacy and security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nomadic computing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure technology for scientific collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 1998, &lt;a href="/news/press_releases/nextgen"&gt;NLM announced&lt;/a&gt; the initial award of 24 Phase I contracts to medical institutions and companies. &lt;a href="/research/ngisumphase1"&gt;Summaries for Phase I project awards&lt;/a&gt; are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Phase II contracts awarded in early FY2000, projects are being implemented in local test-bed settings. &lt;a href="/research/ngisumphase2"&gt;Summaries for all Phase II NGI projects&lt;/a&gt; are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts to apply scaleable advanced network infrastructure to healthcare testbeds were awarded in late FY2003. &lt;a href="/research/siiawards"&gt;Summaries for all scaleable information infrastructure (SII) projects&lt;/a&gt; are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Further Information and Additional Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assist in the development of an NGI that meets the nation's health requirements, NLM has funded a study by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. The Computer Science and Telecommunications Board of the Academy has examined ways in which the Internet can be used to support applications in clinical care, consumer health, public health, health care finance and administration, professional education, and biomedical research. The report, &lt;a href="http://books.nap.edu/catalog/9750.html"&gt;Networking Health: Prescriptions for the Internet&lt;/a&gt;, was released on 23 February 2000. (See &lt;a href="/disclaimer"&gt;disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information on other NGI activities can be found at the following site: (See &lt;a href="/disclaimer"&gt;disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nitrd.gov/"&gt;National Coordinating Office for Networking Information Technology Research and Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet 2 and related information is available through the website of the &lt;a href="http://www.internet2.edu/"&gt;University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development&lt;/a&gt;. (See &lt;a href="/disclaimer"&gt;disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;UMLS&amp;reg; Applications&lt;/h2&gt;
--&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NLM Applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt; offers free access to MEDLINE&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt; (with links to participating on-line journals), and other related databases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;NLM Gateway&lt;/a&gt; allows users to search in multiple retrieval systems at the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM). The current Gateway searches MEDLINE and OLDMEDLINE using PubMed, LOCATORplus, AIDS Meetings, HSRProj, and MedlinePlus&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medical terms can be difficult to remember, and often there are many names for a single concept (e.g., cancer of the colon, colonic neoplasm, colon cancer, etc.). Thus, &lt;a href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/"&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/a&gt; uses the UMLS to automatically add words related to those that searchers enter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NLM &lt;a href="http://ii.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;Indexing Initiative&lt;/a&gt; uses the UMLS as a major component in investigating automated indexing methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other institutions and individuals are applying the UMLS Knowledge Sources and lexical programs. Here are a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;!--
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.apelon.com/products/products_thesaurus.htm" mce_href="http://www.apelon.com/products/products_thesaurus.htm"&gt;Distributed Terminology System&lt;/a&gt; is a middleware component intended for use by both caregivers and medical records personnel. Metaphrase converts the informal language natural to a caregiver into terms from formal controlled vocabularies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mwsearch.com/" mce_href="http://www.mwsearch.com/"&gt;Medical World Search&lt;/a&gt; searches full text from thousands of selected medical sites on the World Wide Web&lt;/li&gt;
--&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.guideline.gov/"&gt;National Guidelines Clearinghouse&lt;/a&gt;, an AHRQ initiative, is a public resource for evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.qualitymeasures.ahrq.gov/"&gt;National Quality Measures Clearinghouse&lt;/a&gt;, sponsored by AHRQ, is a public repository for evidence-based quality measures and measure sets. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.nci.nih.gov/cancerinfo/terminologyresources"&gt;NCI Thesaurus and Enterprise Vocabulary Services&lt;/a&gt; includes reference terminology and related vocabulary resources to help researchers, clinicians, and administrators identify types of cancer, treatments, and other cancer related topics.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>UMLS Database Query Diagrams</title>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UMLS RRF (Rich Release Format) files are a collection of relational files containing the UMLS Metathesaurus data. The data in these files have been denormalized in a variety of ways to allow them to be more easily accessed and to retain the access paths similar to the Original Release Format (ORF). One consequence of this is an inability to render the data model as a strict set of Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams. For example, the MRSAT.RRF file contains attributes on both atom objects (MRCONSO.RRF data) and relationship objects (MRREL.RRF data). Thus, the METAUI field of MRSAT.RRF links to both MRCONSO.RRF (AUI) and MRREL.RRF (RUI) files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative, there are a set of ER-like diagrams called &amp;#8220;query diagrams.&amp;#8221; Each diagram considers a particular use case and shows how the files can be joined (or queried) to find all relevant data for that use case. The diagrams and accompanying queries assume a load of the RRF data files into an Oracle database using the load scripts created by the MetamorphoSys (MMSYS) installation tool. Another way to think about these diagrams: each one shows how to answer a particular kind of question involving UMLS Metathesaurus data. For example, &lt;a href="er3"&gt;the Source Concept (SCUI value) diagram&lt;/a&gt; shows how the tables can be queried and joined to look up all data associated with a SCUI. For each case, there are two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A diagram showing how the UMLS Metathesaurus tables can be joined together in the context of this use case. This is the &amp;#8220;query diagram.&amp;#8221; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A set of queries (runnable against an Oracle load of RRF data) that enact the joins shown in the query diagram. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: the diagrams and queries are not indended to be complete or comprehensive. There are other aspects of Metathesaurus data that are not covered here. This is an attempt to provide information on the most common and most useful ways of interacting with UMLS data in the Rich Release Format (RRF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="rightside"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Query Diagrams&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to find all information associated with&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="er1"&gt;A particular UMLS concept (CUI value)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="er2"&gt;A particular atom (AUI value)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="er3"&gt;A particular source concept (SCUI value)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="er4"&gt;The metadata for a particular atom (AUI value)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="er5"&gt;The metadata for a particular relationship (RUI value) or attribute (ATUI value)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to perform searches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="er6"&gt;For normalized strings, normalized words, or regular words&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="er10"&gt;For root and versioned source metadata concepts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="er11"&gt;For content view metadata concepts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="er12"&gt;For subset metadata concepts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="er7"&gt;In the UMLS history files (MRAUI.RRF and MRCUI.RRF&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="er8"&gt;In the source history file (MRHIST.RRF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="er9"&gt;In the mapping files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;MetamorphoSys can generate custom load scripts for MySQL, Oracle, or Microsoft&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt; Access when creating a Metathesaurus subset or installing the Semantic Network. Instructions for loading a subset of the UMLS Metathesaurus or Semantic Network into a database, by using the scripts and files created by MetamorphoSys, are provided below. &amp;#160;Some modification of the scripts created by MetamorphoSys might be needed under special circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are having problems with the current release, consult the &lt;a href="/research/umls/knowledge_sources/metathesaurus/release/notes"&gt;Release Notes and Problems (Bugs)&lt;/a&gt;. If you are having problems with a previous release, consult the &lt;a href="/research/umls/knowledge_sources/metathesaurus/release/bugs_previous"&gt;Previous Release Bugs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Metathesaurus Load Scripts for MySQL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="README_ORF_MySQL_Output_Stream"&gt;Original Release Format MySQL Load Script&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="README_RRF_MySQL_Output_Stream"&gt;Rich Release Format MySQL Load Script&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructions for MySQL users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a database specifically for this data. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The database must use the UTF-8 character set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Metathesaurus Load Scripts for Oracle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="README_ORF_Oracle_Output_Stream"&gt;Original Release Format Oracle Load Script&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="README_RRF_Oracle_Output_Stream"&gt;Rich Release Format Oracle Load Script&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructions for Oracle users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a schema specifically for this data. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set tablespace at unlimited, or high enough to ensure the amount of space available is what is needed by the data. Granting UNLIMITED TABLESPACE is acceptable as long as "AUTOEXTEND" is turned on to allow for unlimited table space growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create synonyms for tables or only access tables using the same login used to create them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not use the SYS/SYSTEM account to load data into the database since the default table space is SYSTEM, which is reserved for the data dictionary. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use MTH or another account to insert data into the database; do not use "AS SYSDBA" to see the tables. Setting the proper grants from the beginning will solve this problem. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The loader script must be changed to SCHEMA.TABLE format to insert data into the proper tables if the SYS/SYSTEM account is used. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The database must use the UTF-8 character set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Metathesaurus Load Scripts for Microsoft&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt; Access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="README_RRF_Access_Output_Stream"&gt;Rich Release Format Microsoft Access Load Script&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructions for Microsoft&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt; users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the .mdb database file created by MetamorphoSys as starting point. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data files must use the UTF-16LE character set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Semantic Network Load Scripts for MySQL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="README_Semantic_Network_MySQL"&gt;Semantic Network File Format MySQL Load Script&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructions for MySQL users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a database specifically for this data or reuse he database from a Metathesaurus data load.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The database must use the UTF-8 character set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Semantic Network Load Scripts for Oracle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="README_Semantic_Network_Oracle"&gt;Semantic Network File Format Oracle Load Script&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructions for Oracle users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a schema specifically for this data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create synonyms for tables or only access tables using the same login used to create them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not use the SYS/SYSTEM account to load data into the database since the default table space is SYSTEM, which is reserved for the data dictionary. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use SN or another account to insert data into the database; do not use "AS SYSDBA" to see the tables. Setting the proper grants from the beginning will solve this problem. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The loader script must be changed to SCHEMA.TABLE format to insert data into the proper tables if the SYS/SYSTEM account is used. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The database must use the UTF-8 character set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <body>&lt;!--Metathesaurus - Mapping Projects --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="loinc.html#loinc_to_cpt"&gt;LOINC to CPT Mapping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basic Mapping Project Assumptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health care providers must produce billing and statistical data using the HIPAA code sets. The use of standard clinical vocabularies will be more attractive and cost-effective if required HIPAA code set data can be generated from health care information recorded using standard clinical vocabularies. For this reason, the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) and others have recommended that the Federal government support the production and maintenance of robust mappings from standard clinical terminologies to the HIPAA code sets. The NCVHS has also recommended mappings between standard clinical vocabularies and other important vocabularies, such as regulatory and interface terminologies. NLM has been recommended as the appropriate body to coordinate and/or develop and disseminate the mappings within the UMLS Metathesaurus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="assumptions"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;NLM is proceeding to assist existing mapping projects and to set up new ones under the following &lt;strong&gt;basic assumptions&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mappings are sets of relationships of varying complexity established between two vocabularies in order to allow automated translation or connection between them. More specific concepts can generally be mapped accurately to more general concepts. Mappings cannot be used to add specificity to information that was captured at a more generic level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The producers of both vocabularies in any map must participate in the mapping effort to ensure that the result accurately reflects the meaning and usage of their vocabulary. At a minimum, both vocabulary producers must participate in defining the basic purpose and parameters of the mapping task, reviewing and verifying the map, developing the plan for testing and validation, and devising a cost effective strategy for building, maintaining, and enhancing the map over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Target users of the map must participate in its design and testing to ensure that it is fit for its intended purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Production of mappings will be an iterative process, which must involve testing, validation, and use in real world settings. The functionality of mappings will improve over time as research, testing, and use determine (a) useful ways to construct and represent complex mappings (such as those that involve conditional rules) and (b) the extent they can be applied in the real world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The creation of mappings is likely to suggest ways to improve the vocabularies on both ends of the map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CMS and other payers must validate the process used to produce mappings that will be used to generate claims data from clinical data. As a result, CMS must be involved in developing plans for initial and ongoing testing and validation of these mappings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NLM may provide financial and, as necessary, technical support to vocabulary producers and others who participate in creating, reviewing, testing, and validating mappings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new UMLS Metathesaurus Rich Release Format provides an appropriate distribution mechanism for purpose-specific mappings between pairs of vocabularies. NLM will distribute mappings between standard clinical vocabularies, HIPAA code sets, and other key vocabularies used in Federal health information systems within the UMLS Metathesaurus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UMLS users&amp;#8217; ability to use a mapping will be governed by their licenses to use the two vocabularies in the mapping.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is the UMLS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UMLS, or Unified Medical Language System, is a set of files and software that brings together many health and biomedical vocabularies and standards to enable interoperability between computer systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the UMLS to enhance or develop applications, such as electronic health records, classification tools, dictionaries and language translators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name="UMLS_in_Use"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UMLS in Use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One powerful use of the UMLS is linking health information, medical terms, drug names, and billing codes across different computer systems. Some examples of this are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linking terms and codes between your doctor, your pharmacy, and your insurance company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patient care coordination among several departments within a hospital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UMLS has many other uses, including search engine retrieval, data mining, public health statistics reporting, and terminology research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a name="The_Three_UMLS_Tools"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Three UMLS Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UMLS has three tools, which we call the Knowledge Sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Metathesaurus&lt;/strong&gt;: Terms and codes from many vocabularies, including CPT&amp;#174;, ICD-10-CM, LOINC&amp;#174;, MeSH&amp;#174;, RxNorm, and SNOMED CT&amp;#174;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Semantic Network&lt;/strong&gt;: Broad categories (semantic types) and their relationships (semantic relations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;SPECIALIST Lexicon and Lexical Tools&lt;/strong&gt;: Natural language processing tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the Semantic Network and Lexical Tools to produce the Metathesaurus. Metathesaurus production involves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processing the terms and codes using the Lexical Tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grouping synonymous terms into concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Categorizing concepts by semantic types from the Semantic Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporating relationships and attributes provided by vocabularies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Releasing the data in a common format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we integrate these tools for Metathesaurus production, you can access them separately or in any combination according to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Access the UMLS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UMLS Terminology Services (UTS) provides three ways to access the UMLS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Web Browsers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can search the data through UTS applications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Metathesaurus Browser&lt;/strong&gt; - Retrieve UMLS concept information, including CUIs, semantic types, and synonymous terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Semantic Network Browser&lt;/strong&gt; - View the names, definitions, and hierarchical structure of the Semantic Network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Local Installation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install the UMLS on your computer, download the files through the UTS. The MetamorphoSys tool, included with the downloaded files, allows you to customize the UMLS according to your needs. You can then load your customized data into your own database system, such as MySQL or Oracle, or you may browse your data using the MetamorphoSys RRF browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Web Services APIs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use our application programming interfaces (APIs) to query the UMLS data within your own application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Get Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request a license and sign up for a UMLS Terminology Services (UTS) account.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UMLS licenses are issued only to individuals and not to groups or organizations. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no charge for licensing the UMLS from NLM. NLM is a member of the &lt;a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org/"&gt;IHTSDO&lt;/a&gt; (owner of SNOMED CT), and there is no charge for SNOMED CT use in the United States and &lt;a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org/members/"&gt;other member countries&lt;/a&gt;. Some uses of the UMLS may require additional agreements with individual terminology vendors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UTS account allows you to browse, download, and query the UMLS. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>RxNorm Current Prescribable Content</title>
    <branding>UMLS</branding>

    <permanence>Permanent: Dynamic Content</permanence>
    <body>&lt;h3&gt;RxNorm Current Prescribable Content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RxNorm Current Prescribable Content is a subset of currently prescribable drugs found in RxNorm. We intend it to be an approximation of the prescription drugs currently marketed in the US. The subset also includes many over-the-counter drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subset includes only the active RxNorm normalized names, codes (RxCUIs), attributes, and relationships, as well as the FDA structured product label drugs and ingredients. It does not include data from any of the other 10 RxNorm data providers, such as First DataBank, Micromedex, or the Veterans Administration. We also removed suppressed and obsolete data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Library of Medicine provides this subset without any licensing restrictions. You do not need to log into the UMLS Terminology Services to access the subset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How does this subset differ from the RxNorm full monthly release?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SAB=RXNORM and SAB=MTHSPL data only; no other source provider data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No license required; public domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No obsolete or suppressed data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No drugs that are exclusively non-US, or foreign drugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No drugs for exclusive veterinary use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fewer data files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How are the files structured?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file structure of the subset matches the file structure of the RxNorm full monthly releases; however, the subset only includes three data files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RXNCONSO - Drug and ingredient names and codes (detailed in &lt;a href="/research/umls/rxnorm/docs/2014/rxnorm_doco_full_2014-2.html#s12_4"&gt;Section 12.4&lt;/a&gt; of the technical documentation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RXNSAT - Attributes, such as NDCs and UNII codes (detailed in &lt;a href="/research/umls/rxnorm/docs/2014/rxnorm_doco_full_2014-2.html#s12_5"&gt;Section 12.5&lt;/a&gt; of the technical documentation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RXNREL - Relationships that link drug names (detailed in &lt;a href="/research/umls/rxnorm/docs/2014/rxnorm_doco_full_2014-2.html#s12_7"&gt;Section 12.7&lt;/a&gt; of the technical documentation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have scripts for loading the RxNorm data into Oracle and MySQL databases; these are included with the release files. For directions on using the load scripts, see &lt;a href="/research/umls/rxnorm/docs/2014/rxnorm_doco_full_2014-2.html#s13_0"&gt;Section 13&lt;/a&gt; of the technical documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Are the subset components flagged in the regular RxNorm release?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All ingredient and drug names found in the Current Prescribable Content subset are flagged with a value of "4096" in the CVF field in the RXNCONSO, RXNSAT, and RXNREL fields of the RxNorm Full Monthly Release Files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is the release cycle for the subset?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We produce the subset at the beginning of each month with the RxNorm full monthly release. You can download the subset from the &lt;a href="/research/umls/rxnorm/docs/rxnormfiles"&gt;RxNorm Files page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also provide weekly updates that contain new data from the FDA Structured Product Labels (SAB=MTHSPL) and the SAB=RXNORM normalized names that go with them. The weekly updates are meant to be used in conjunction with the monthly release of the Current Prescribable Content. You can download the weekly updates from the &lt;a href="/research/umls/rxnorm/docs/rxnormfiles"&gt;RxNorm Files page&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also access the monthly release and the weekly updates of the Current Prescribable Content subset within the download files for the regular RxNorm releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This subset is in draft form and will change over time. We welcome comments on the content and format. Please contact us at: rxnorminfo@nlm.nih.gov&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;p&gt;RxNorm provides normalized names for clinical drugs and links its names to many of the drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug interaction software, including those of First Databank, Micromedex, MediSpan, Gold Standard Drug Database, and Multum. By providing links between these vocabularies, RxNorm can mediate messages between systems not using the same software and vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RxNorm now includes the National Drug File - Reference Terminology (NDF-RT) from the Veterans Health Administration. NDF-RT is a terminology used to code clinical drug properties, including mechanism of action, physiologic effect, and therapeutic category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="snomed_faq.html#what"&gt;SNOMED CT&lt;/a&gt; (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine--Clinical Terms) is a comprehensive clinical terminology, originally created by the &lt;a href="http://www.cap.org/"&gt;College of American Pathologists&lt;/a&gt; (CAP) and, as of April 2007, owned, maintained, and distributed by the &lt;a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org"&gt;International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (IHTSDO), a not-for-profit association in Denmark. The CAP continues to support SNOMED CT operations under contract to the IHTSDO and provides SNOMED-related products and services as a licensee of the terminology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NLM is the U.S. Member of the IHTSDO and, as such, distributes SNOMED CT at no cost in accordance with the Member rights and responsibilities outlined in the IHTSDO's &lt;a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org/articles.pdf"&gt;Articles&lt;/a&gt;. The IHTSDO's uniform international license terms for SNOMED CT will replace the U.S.-wide license terms NLM negotiated with the CAP in 2003, giving U.S. users broader rights to distribute derivative products internationally. The new license terms have been incorporated into the &lt;a href="https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/license.html"&gt;License for Use of the UMLS Metathesaurus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licensees of the UMLS Metathesaurus have access to SNOMED CT (both English and Spanish versions) in multiple formats - as part of the UMLS Metathesaurus, where it is linked to many other biomedical terminologies and natural language processing tools. Additionally UMLS licensees will now have free access to SNOMED CT in its native file formats downloaded directly from the &lt;a href="https://uts.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;UTS&lt;/a&gt;. The IHTSDO license terms for SNOMED CT cover use and distribution worldwide, but fees may be applicable outside IHTSDO Member countries. A list of &lt;a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org/members/"&gt;current member countries&lt;/a&gt; and information on becoming a member country is available on the IHTSDO website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SNOMED CT is one of a suite of designated standards for use in U.S. Federal Government systems for the electronic exchange of clinical health information and is also a required standard in interoperability specifications of the &lt;a href="http://www.hitsp.org"&gt;U.S. Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel&lt;/a&gt;. SNOMED CT is also being implemented internationally as a standard within other &lt;a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org/members/"&gt;IHTSDO Member countries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For general information on drug screening and workplace drug screening tests, we suggest the following resources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="false" name="false"&gt;False Positive Results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find citations to published articles about false positives in drug testing, you can search PubMed&amp;#174;. Please note: PubMed does not contain whole articles, just citations and abstracts, with some links to full-text on publisher Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To search PubMed&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt;, enter the following into the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt; search box:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="spacedList"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substance Abuse Detection [mh] AND False Positive Reactions[mh] AND English[la].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add "AND" followed by a specific drug name for more focused results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="/bsd/disted/pubmed"&gt;PubMed tutorials&lt;/a&gt; are available for more search suggestions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another resource is &lt;a href="http://labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/drug-abuse/tab/sample"&gt;Drugs of Abuse Testing&lt;/a&gt;, Lab Tests Online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also encourage you to talk with your pharmacist or health provider about &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?cdrid=340929"&gt;a false positive result&lt;/a&gt; of a specific medication, food, or drink in a drug screening test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Collection Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policies and guidelines for building NLM&amp;#8217;s collection are described in the Collection Development Manual of the National Library of Medicine. The Manual is reviewed and updated periodically to reflect emerging changes in health care and advances in medical research. NLM coordinates its collection development policies and retention practices with those of the Library of Congress (LC) and the National Agricultural Library (NAL).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>List of Serials Indexed for Online Users</title>

    <permanence>Permanent: Dynamic Content</permanence>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;List of Serials Indexed for Online Users (LSIOU)&lt;/em&gt; provides bibliographic information for all journals whose articles were ever indexed over time with the MeSH&lt;span class="registered"&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/span&gt; vocabulary and cited in MEDLINE&lt;span class="registered"&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/span&gt;, the backbone of the NLM PubMed&lt;span class="registered"&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/span&gt; database. It includes titles that ceased publication, changed titles, or are no longer indexed. More detailed bibliographic data and information about indexing coverage for serials cited in MEDLINE/PubMed can be found in &lt;a href="http://locatorplus.gov/"&gt;LocatorPlus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="registered"&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/span&gt;, the NLM online catalog, and the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/"&gt;NLM Catalog&lt;/a&gt;, an Entrez database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2014 edition of the LSIOU contains 14,772 serial titles, including 5,651 titles currently indexed for MEDLINE as well as titles indexed over time which have ceased or changed titles, listed alphabetically by the journal title abbreviation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LSIOU is produced in XML. Use of the data is permitted after reading &lt;a href="/tsd/serials/terms_cond"&gt;Terms and Conditions&lt;/a&gt; (includes the links to the DTD and the data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tailored lists of indexed journals may be generated from the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/"&gt;NLM Catalog&lt;/a&gt;. While the XML version of the LSIOU is a snapshot in time, the results of a search in the NLM Catalog will provide a "real time" list for the LSIOU. Enter reportedmedline in the search box and click "Search".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;List of Journals Indexed for MEDLINE&lt;/em&gt; ceased with the 2008 edition. For a list of only the currently indexed MEDLINE journals, enter currentlyindexed in the search box and click "Search".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Display and sort formats are selected from the results page: click on the Display Settings link to choose a display format (for example, the Journal display) and an appropriate sort (for example, Title or Title Abbreviation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To save the entire list as one document, click on the "Send to" pull-down, "File" as the destination, choose a format and sort order, and then click "Create File." Click "Save" in the File Download pop-up box. Provide your directory location and desired file name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information about journals indexed for MEDLINE can be found via the links from the &lt;a href="/bsd/pmresources.html#journals"&gt;MEDLINE/PubMed Resources&lt;/a&gt; Web page. This page includes &lt;a href="/bsd/lstrc/new_titles"&gt;Journals Recently Accepted by NLM for Inclusion in MEDLINE&lt;/a&gt;, a list of titles selected by the Literature Selection Technical Review Committee (&lt;a href="/pubs/factsheets/jsel"&gt;LSTRC&lt;/a&gt;), which meets three times per year in February, June, and October. Results from those meetings appear online about six weeks after each meeting, both on the Web page and in the NLM Catalog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All serial bibliographic records in LocatorPlus (and hence, in the NLM Catalog), whether or not cataloged by NLM, are available via SERFILE for lease at no cost. See &lt;a href="/databases/catser"&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/catser.html&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;</body>
